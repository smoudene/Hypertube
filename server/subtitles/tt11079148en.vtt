00:00:53.263 --> 00:00:54.806
<i>Rebmemer...</i>

2
00:01:00.395 --> 00:01:01.896
<i>Remember, John.</i>

3
00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:06.234
Remember.

4
00:01:12.031 --> 00:01:13.116
Remember what?

5
00:01:14.784 --> 00:01:15.952
That I love you.

6
00:01:18.246 --> 00:01:20.164
Didn't think that was in doubt, Zee.

7
00:01:34.304 --> 00:01:35.638
I just wanted to say it,

8
00:01:36.222 --> 00:01:38.016
- before...
- Before nothing.

9
00:01:38.808 --> 00:01:39.910
The League will sort this out

10
00:01:39.934 --> 00:01:42.145
and we'll be havin' pints by sundown.

11
00:01:44.772 --> 00:01:46.566
Or whatever that is 'round here.

12
00:01:58.286 --> 00:02:00.079
I'm glad you joined the League.

13
00:02:00.496 --> 00:02:01.914
I'm here for you, love.

14
00:02:02.415 --> 00:02:04.709
Just don't ask me to wear a cape.

15
00:02:08.588 --> 00:02:11.308
<i>All Justice League
members, report to the hangar, now.</i>

16
00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:14.135
Way to cock-block, Batsy.

17
00:02:16.262 --> 00:02:17.262
Well...

18
00:02:17.847 --> 00:02:18.847
time to go.

19
00:02:31.986 --> 00:02:33.826
Thank you for responding so quickly.

20
00:02:35.114 --> 00:02:37.241
Some of you already know
what this is about,

21
00:02:37.367 --> 00:02:39.661
but I wanted to get
the new members up to speed.

22
00:02:40.953 --> 00:02:42.622
This is Apokolips,

23
00:02:42.705 --> 00:02:44.457
home world of Darkseid,

24
00:02:44.749 --> 00:02:45.917
a power-mad despot

25
00:02:46.042 --> 00:02:49.170
who has orchestrated
two attempted invasions of Earth,

26
00:02:49.587 --> 00:02:52.590
the first of which resulted
in the formation of the Justice League.

27
00:02:52.757 --> 00:02:55.468
The second one,
an attack from within our ranks

28
00:02:55.551 --> 00:02:58.721
by Cyborg Superman and his cyber force.

29
00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:04.143
Raven, what's wrong?

30
00:03:06.187 --> 00:03:07.230
It's nothing.

31
00:03:09.232 --> 00:03:11.776
This image was taken by surveillance
ten hours ago

32
00:03:11.859 --> 00:03:13.361
on the edge of the solar system.

33
00:03:13.778 --> 00:03:17.156
Apokolips phased into our dimension
and released stealth drones,

34
00:03:17.323 --> 00:03:18.408
then phased out again.

35
00:03:18.616 --> 00:03:21.160
This can only be looked at
as a prelude to war.

36
00:03:21.577 --> 00:03:23.246
Darkseid aims to conquer the Earth

37
00:03:23.329 --> 00:03:25.081
and crush it under his heel.

38
00:03:25.707 --> 00:03:28.126
Regular Churchill, he is.

39
00:03:28.626 --> 00:03:30.586
Look, I know
the guy's a genocidal maniac,

40
00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:32.588
but are we sure those are
his immediate plans,

41
00:03:32.672 --> 00:03:35.007
or something he'll try
in like a thousand years?

42
00:03:36.884 --> 00:03:40.012
These are images from worlds
that Darkseid has conquered.

43
00:03:40.805 --> 00:03:43.933
<i>Our intel shows
that he's now sent his elite guard</i>

44
00:03:44.016 --> 00:03:46.477
<i>and the Furies to act
as an occupying force</i>

45
00:03:47.186 --> 00:03:49.480
to thwart any resistance.

46
00:03:50.815 --> 00:03:52.734
I want to make this perfectly clear.

47
00:03:53.109 --> 00:03:56.154
We are facing
an existential threat to the planet.

48
00:03:56.738 --> 00:04:00.158
We can't wait for Darkseid
to make the first move.

49
00:04:00.658 --> 00:04:02.493
That could mean the end of us.

50
00:04:04.537 --> 00:04:06.330
We have to attack.

51
00:04:07.623 --> 00:04:08.750
It's a tough job.

52
00:04:09.083 --> 00:04:10.083
Aside from the big bad,

53
00:04:10.126 --> 00:04:12.295
this place is jam-packed
with those Parademons.

54
00:04:12.795 --> 00:04:14.422
The League's faced them before.

55
00:04:14.839 --> 00:04:16.759
We know these are their weak spots.

56
00:04:16.966 --> 00:04:19.260
With our combined force,
we can cut through them.

57
00:04:19.469 --> 00:04:21.137
Then, I'll do what needs to be done.

58
00:04:21.596 --> 00:04:23.055
This is madness.

59
00:04:23.306 --> 00:04:25.308
There's always a deal to be made.

60
00:04:25.767 --> 00:04:28.519
Let's at least send an envoy
to Apokolips.

61
00:04:28.603 --> 00:04:29.687
No!

62
00:04:34.066 --> 00:04:36.569
Darkseid created a monster
that nearly killed me.

63
00:04:36.652 --> 00:04:38.780
What chance would humanity have?

64
00:04:39.363 --> 00:04:42.408
Our only option is to destroy him.

65
00:04:43.201 --> 00:04:45.953
That means Earth could be
ground zero in a world war.

66
00:04:46.037 --> 00:04:48.372
Look, I know some of you don't believe

67
00:04:48.456 --> 00:04:50.917
the visions I had
about the Flashpoint...

68
00:04:51.083 --> 00:04:52.877
but a truly global war

69
00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:56.297
means death and destruction
on a scale you cannot imagine.

70
00:04:56.756 --> 00:04:59.050
Everyone on the planet is at risk,

71
00:04:59.383 --> 00:05:00.676
everyone we care about.

72
00:05:01.928 --> 00:05:03.554
- Flash is right.
- John.

73
00:05:03.638 --> 00:05:05.306
Sure, this guy deserves killing,

74
00:05:05.389 --> 00:05:08.976
but you can't kick this hornet's nest
like everyone on Earth is bulletproof.

75
00:05:09.852 --> 00:05:12.855
Look, I won't ask you to give
anything more than I do.

76
00:05:14.106 --> 00:05:15.441
But this isn't up for discussion.

77
00:05:16.526 --> 00:05:19.153
We're going to stop Darkseid
once and for all.

78
00:05:20.488 --> 00:05:21.531
Here's how we do it.

79
00:05:23.908 --> 00:05:26.911
The main team will attack
through this entryway on Apokolips.

80
00:05:27.703 --> 00:05:30.331
Members of the Titans shall
remain on Earth as a home guard.

81
00:05:32.959 --> 00:05:34.961
<i>With the Furies
and his elite guard off-world,</i>

82
00:05:35.044 --> 00:05:36.364
<i>and only Parademons to guard him,</i>

83
00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:39.382
<i>Darkseid will be vulnerable to attack.</i>

84
00:05:45.137 --> 00:05:47.181
Honey, please get somewhere safe.

85
00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:50.017
<i>Clark, I have a job, just like you.</i>

86
00:05:50.142 --> 00:05:53.062
<i>I may not be able to fight this war,
but I can report the story.</i>

87
00:05:54.063 --> 00:05:55.231
<i>Stop worrying.</i>

88
00:05:57.775 --> 00:05:59.861
Just promise to be
as careful as you can.

89
00:06:00.695 --> 00:06:01.695
<i>I will.</i>

90
00:06:02.029 --> 00:06:03.406
<i>Now go save the world.</i>

91
00:06:04.866 --> 00:06:05.866
I love you.

92
00:06:07.159 --> 00:06:08.159
<i>I know.</i>

93
00:06:27.763 --> 00:06:28.763
Nervous?

94
00:06:29.849 --> 00:06:30.849
Nah.

95
00:06:31.559 --> 00:06:33.060
Could use a ciggie, though.

96
00:06:35.354 --> 00:06:37.732
Preparing Javelin
for inter-dimensional portal.

97
00:06:39.901 --> 00:06:42.236
I got this, Bats. Sit back and relax.

98
00:06:47.325 --> 00:06:48.451
Booyah!

99
00:07:01.714 --> 00:07:02.714
Lovely.

100
00:07:13.476 --> 00:07:15.436
Picking up lifeform readings
coming at us.

101
00:07:16.438 --> 00:07:18.564
But they're too big to be Parademons.

102
00:07:20.524 --> 00:07:22.485
Then what the hell are those things?

103
00:07:32.578 --> 00:07:33.579
Bollocks.

104
00:08:42.148 --> 00:08:43.274
Bollocks.

105
00:08:45.359 --> 00:08:47.778
And that's the last of the Glen Luffa.

106
00:08:48.904 --> 00:08:52.825
The Glens are full of whiskey,
I mean, lots of whiskey.

107
00:08:53.242 --> 00:08:54.785
Mmm... Ah.

108
00:08:57.246 --> 00:08:58.289
Ahh...

109
00:08:58.956 --> 00:09:00.475
The Hs are gonna be a breeze...

110
00:09:00.499 --> 00:09:01.499
...after the Gs.

111
00:09:01.834 --> 00:09:04.670
Too many bloody Glens.

112
00:09:05.671 --> 00:09:06.671
You hear that?

113
00:09:07.381 --> 00:09:09.383
Still cryin' in your beer, eh?

114
00:09:09.967 --> 00:09:11.385
Eat your heart out!

115
00:09:12.678 --> 00:09:14.889
Hello, my old friend, Glen Magoogan.

116
00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:27.485
We need him.

117
00:09:32.364 --> 00:09:33.364
We're doomed.

118
00:09:34.909 --> 00:09:36.077
John Constantine.

119
00:09:39.121 --> 00:09:40.331
I'm glad we found you.

120
00:09:41.457 --> 00:09:43.167
Find your own pub.

121
00:09:43.751 --> 00:09:45.753
We're drinking our way through this one.

122
00:09:46.003 --> 00:09:49.381
In fact, the whole street's ours,
pub-wise, so sod off.

123
00:09:50.132 --> 00:09:51.592
John, it's me.

124
00:09:53.719 --> 00:09:54.719
Clark Kent.

125
00:09:55.554 --> 00:09:56.972
You knew me as Superman.

126
00:10:06.023 --> 00:10:07.566
Ah, it is you.

127
00:10:08.526 --> 00:10:10.236
I thought you'd snuffed it.

128
00:10:14.990 --> 00:10:16.117
Bloody hell.

129
00:10:16.450 --> 00:10:17.868
Now you've done it.

130
00:10:19.662 --> 00:10:20.704
John, wait.

131
00:10:20.871 --> 00:10:22.665
We're not here to fight.

132
00:10:27.419 --> 00:10:29.380
You come to the wrong place, then.

133
00:10:33.467 --> 00:10:34.760
Stop!

134
00:10:38.305 --> 00:10:39.305
Stop it!

135
00:10:44.979 --> 00:10:47.356
Quit playin' around, Boy Scout!
Smash 'em!

136
00:10:47.439 --> 00:10:48.691
I can't!

137
00:10:53.237 --> 00:10:54.947
Bloody useless, both of you.

138
00:11:05.791 --> 00:11:07.418
A little help would be nice.

139
00:11:23.309 --> 00:11:24.351
Ugh!

140
00:11:24.435 --> 00:11:25.895
Bloody nuisance.

141
00:11:32.067 --> 00:11:34.737
Last call, asshole.

142
00:11:39.116 --> 00:11:41.368
And I'm sober again.

143
00:11:41.702 --> 00:11:43.954
Magic can be such a bitch.

144
00:11:50.753 --> 00:11:52.296
Gift from Darkseid?

145
00:11:53.380 --> 00:11:54.548
Liquid Kryptonite

146
00:11:55.132 --> 00:11:56.926
to keep me from ever being a threat.

147
00:11:58.677 --> 00:12:02.681
So he let you live
to wander about demoralizing everyone.

148
00:12:04.808 --> 00:12:05.808
Impressive.

149
00:12:07.770 --> 00:12:09.355
Ah, stop it, please.

150
00:12:10.356 --> 00:12:11.996
She gets like this sometimes.

151
00:12:15.778 --> 00:12:19.240
<i>I will exact vengeance on you, daughter.</i>

152
00:12:19.406 --> 00:12:22.910
<i>Release me, ungrateful spawn of mine.</i>

153
00:12:25.079 --> 00:12:26.622
That's what she hears all the time.

154
00:12:27.081 --> 00:12:28.791
No wonder she's always in pain,

155
00:12:29.458 --> 00:12:31.293
and her healing powers don't work.

156
00:12:31.627 --> 00:12:32.627
John,

157
00:12:32.836 --> 00:12:34.588
where are you going? We have...

158
00:12:34.672 --> 00:12:36.632
A plan to save the world, right?

159
00:12:37.049 --> 00:12:39.635
And this time it will definitely work.

160
00:12:40.052 --> 00:12:41.512
Bugger off, Clarkie.

161
00:12:43.806 --> 00:12:45.474
I told you he was a waste of time.

162
00:12:45.808 --> 00:12:47.268
All cowards are.

163
00:12:49.812 --> 00:12:52.189
I didn't lead us all into a massacre.

164
00:12:52.273 --> 00:12:53.274
You did.

165
00:12:53.899 --> 00:12:56.068
Zatanna was a hero who fought bravely.

166
00:12:56.527 --> 00:12:58.529
But where were you
when she needed you most?

167
00:13:04.952 --> 00:13:07.329
Ah, piss off, both of you.

168
00:13:11.166 --> 00:13:13.585
Zatanna would want you to hear us out.

169
00:13:16.088 --> 00:13:17.881
Below the belt, Boy Scout.

170
00:13:19.591 --> 00:13:21.677
More Parademons will be by.

171
00:13:22.386 --> 00:13:23.721
Come with if you want.

172
00:13:25.097 --> 00:13:26.097
Or not.

173
00:13:26.890 --> 00:13:28.225
What about you, Etrigan?

174
00:13:32.564 --> 00:13:33.690
Whatever.

175
00:13:44.491 --> 00:13:46.251
Love what you've done with the place.

176
00:13:47.536 --> 00:13:50.622
What better metaphor
for merry old England today?

177
00:13:52.541 --> 00:13:53.541
Drink?

178
00:13:54.418 --> 00:13:56.086
You can use the good glasses.

179
00:14:02.051 --> 00:14:04.720
Been all mopey
ever since a friend of his died.

180
00:14:05.471 --> 00:14:07.181
Doesn't even rhyme anymore.

181
00:14:08.182 --> 00:14:10.017
What's the point?

182
00:14:13.354 --> 00:14:15.189
Look, are you going to help us or not?

183
00:14:15.856 --> 00:14:18.317
Saving your asses
in the bar didn't count, eh?

184
00:14:18.734 --> 00:14:21.320
Offering whiskey in an unbroken glass?

185
00:14:21.403 --> 00:14:23.322
Bloody ingrates, you are.

186
00:14:24.281 --> 00:14:27.201
So, it was crap from the start,

187
00:14:27.326 --> 00:14:28.702
but what went wrong, eh?

188
00:14:29.203 --> 00:14:30.788
Tell me what happened.

189
00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:38.879
<i>Darkseid knew
every part of our plan.</i>

190
00:14:41.548 --> 00:14:44.968
<i>Those things that attacked us were
half Parademon, half Doomsday.</i>

191
00:14:48.389 --> 00:14:50.057
<i>Barry and Hal fought hard,</i>

192
00:14:50.599 --> 00:14:51.809
<i>but were taken down.</i>

193
00:14:57.648 --> 00:14:59.650
<i>The rest of us
didn't last much longer.</i>

194
00:15:08.325 --> 00:15:11.453
<i>Shazam was wounded,
but Cyborg helped him escape.</i>

195
00:15:26.260 --> 00:15:27.594
No!

196
00:15:36.770 --> 00:15:38.439
<i>Darkseid didn't kill everyone.</i>

197
00:15:38.856 --> 00:15:41.275
<i>Some, he had plans for.</i>

198
00:15:59.585 --> 00:16:01.628
A few days later, Darkseid sent those...

199
00:16:02.087 --> 00:16:03.797
"Paradooms" to Earth.

200
00:16:04.715 --> 00:16:06.008
We didn't have a chance.

201
00:16:08.135 --> 00:16:09.136
Does it hurt?

202
00:16:14.099 --> 00:16:15.099
Good.

203
00:16:15.601 --> 00:16:17.936
Even without powers,
Clark is still fighting.

204
00:16:18.228 --> 00:16:20.022
You couldn't be bothered to do it once.

205
00:16:30.657 --> 00:16:32.034
John!

206
00:16:46.173 --> 00:16:47.573
<i>Don't know why I ran.</i>

207
00:16:49.426 --> 00:16:52.638
Been up against all sorts of bastards
and I always stood tall.

208
00:16:53.472 --> 00:16:55.015
But this time I just ran.

209
00:16:56.600 --> 00:16:57.851
Why did I do that?

210
00:16:58.560 --> 00:16:59.560
Why?

211
00:17:06.777 --> 00:17:08.654
What do you need me for anyway?

212
00:17:08.737 --> 00:17:10.989
The magic you have left
works just as good as mine.

213
00:17:11.532 --> 00:17:13.283
We just need a locator spell.

214
00:17:15.827 --> 00:17:17.287
A locator spell?

215
00:17:17.746 --> 00:17:19.915
And then you'll toddle off, will ya?

216
00:17:21.208 --> 00:17:22.417
Fine.

217
00:17:26.713 --> 00:17:28.674
I need some gear, so sit tight.

218
00:17:28.799 --> 00:17:31.552
Etrigan, continue loafing.

219
00:17:32.553 --> 00:17:33.553
Done.

220
00:18:23.103 --> 00:18:25.480
The third planet reaper
is on the Earth's surface.

221
00:18:26.189 --> 00:18:28.191
Boring to the magma core has begun.

222
00:18:29.026 --> 00:18:30.360
With that ordnance,

223
00:18:30.611 --> 00:18:34.406
the guardians of Oa
will be forced to bow before me,

224
00:18:34.489 --> 00:18:37.034
and the entire space sector
will be mine.

225
00:18:37.909 --> 00:18:40.746
Why was this not completed earlier?

226
00:18:41.246 --> 00:18:43.165
The damage done to the Apokolips reactor

227
00:18:43.248 --> 00:18:46.209
- during the attack two years ago...
- Your attack.

228
00:18:47.794 --> 00:18:49.421
My solution is working,

229
00:18:49.504 --> 00:18:52.507
but the power generated
is less than your previous reactor.

230
00:18:54.843 --> 00:18:56.386
Perhaps my mind-molding

231
00:18:56.470 --> 00:18:59.806
didn't fully transform you
into a capable servant.

232
00:19:00.557 --> 00:19:04.061
Perhaps you'd serve me better
as a mindless drone.

233
00:19:06.521 --> 00:19:09.691
I am still your most competent acolyte,
Lord Darkseid.

234
00:19:12.069 --> 00:19:15.405
Your former teammate, Luthor,
believes otherwise.

235
00:19:16.573 --> 00:19:17.741
Not surprising.

236
00:19:17.824 --> 00:19:20.452
Luthor's only interest
is saving his own skin.

237
00:19:21.119 --> 00:19:23.747
I only perform my duties
at your pleasure, my liege.

238
00:19:24.289 --> 00:19:27.292
I won't stand for further delays.

239
00:19:28.001 --> 00:19:32.422
After all, a conqueror must conquer.

240
00:19:43.392 --> 00:19:44.726
I thought there'd be fire.

241
00:19:45.268 --> 00:19:46.812
Only when I fart.

242
00:19:47.729 --> 00:19:49.523
<i>We need to reassess the situation.</i>

243
00:19:50.065 --> 00:19:51.858
<i>Gather our forces to a new location.</i>

244
00:19:52.192 --> 00:19:53.985
<i>Another one just landed in China.</i>

245
00:19:54.486 --> 00:19:55.779
Any idea what they're for?

246
00:19:55.904 --> 00:19:56.862
<i>No.</i>

247
00:19:56.863 --> 00:19:58.365
<i>But whatever it is can't be good.</i>

248
00:19:58.573 --> 00:19:59.853
<i>We need to come up with a new...</i>

249
00:20:01.702 --> 00:20:03.704
Oh, no, come on.

250
00:20:04.454 --> 00:20:06.254
Let's get you on your way, then.

251
00:20:12.963 --> 00:20:14.172
Who am I finding?

252
00:20:15.006 --> 00:20:16.299
Damian Wayne.

253
00:20:17.551 --> 00:20:19.052
Are you bloody daft, mate?

254
00:20:20.053 --> 00:20:22.556
And how exactly does the Baby Bat help?

255
00:20:23.056 --> 00:20:24.099
What do you care?

256
00:20:26.184 --> 00:20:27.184
Cheers, then.

257
00:20:42.784 --> 00:20:43.910
Okay,

258
00:20:44.244 --> 00:20:47.247
since I don't have a stocked
magical pantry anymore,

259
00:20:47.330 --> 00:20:49.166
I have to conjure a portal from scratch

260
00:20:49.249 --> 00:20:50.500
big enough for all of us.

261
00:20:51.501 --> 00:20:53.003
Ten hours, give or take.

262
00:20:53.170 --> 00:20:55.090
Oh, and everyone has
to stay still while I do it.

263
00:20:55.213 --> 00:20:56.465
Oh, for fuck's sake.

264
00:20:57.716 --> 00:20:59.196
Raven, no, you're too weak...

265
00:21:08.894 --> 00:21:11.563
I... I didn't mean to imply
anything of the sort.

266
00:21:11.897 --> 00:21:14.608
When Lord Darkseid
asked if I could do your job,

267
00:21:14.691 --> 00:21:17.152
I answered, "Maybe one day," but...

268
00:21:17.235 --> 00:21:18.862
<i>Luthor, stop sniveling.</i>

269
00:21:21.198 --> 00:21:22.532
<i>Continue your report.</i>

270
00:21:23.575 --> 00:21:24.701
Yes, Batman.

271
00:21:25.327 --> 00:21:28.705
The last of Earth's resources
are being transferred to Apokolips.

272
00:21:29.039 --> 00:21:31.917
Everything will go according
to Darkseid's schedule.

273
00:21:33.293 --> 00:21:37.714
Um, do you know if I'm included
in His Lordship's plans?

274
00:21:37.839 --> 00:21:41.051
In a future where I'm alive
to serve you both?

275
00:21:42.511 --> 00:21:45.722
<i>My business is ensuring that
Darkseid's vision is executed</i>

276
00:21:45.806 --> 00:21:49.017
<i>so his reign spreads
to every corner of the galaxy.</i>

277
00:21:50.644 --> 00:21:52.938
<i>Don't worry about your place
in those plans.</i>

278
00:21:53.146 --> 00:21:55.190
<i>Worry about doing what I tell you.</i>

279
00:21:56.024 --> 00:21:57.442
Of course, Batman.

280
00:22:22.300 --> 00:22:24.386
The infidels
have breached our sanctuary.

281
00:22:24.845 --> 00:22:25.846
Slay them.

282
00:22:29.724 --> 00:22:30.934
Are you happy now?

283
00:22:31.393 --> 00:22:32.561
Assassins!

284
00:22:36.314 --> 00:22:38.108
Some challenge.

285
00:22:38.733 --> 00:22:39.818
Yawn.

286
00:23:03.341 --> 00:23:05.260
Etrigan the Slayer is here.

287
00:23:05.343 --> 00:23:07.721
Woe to you. And you.

288
00:23:09.556 --> 00:23:10.640
You also.

289
00:23:13.435 --> 00:23:14.603
Die, demon!

290
00:23:21.985 --> 00:23:23.028
Whatever.

291
00:23:30.577 --> 00:23:31.577
Enough!

292
00:23:49.679 --> 00:23:50.679
Hi.

293
00:23:52.682 --> 00:23:53.725
You.

294
00:23:53.808 --> 00:23:56.895
Damian, please listen to him.

295
00:23:58.730 --> 00:23:59.814
What's wrong with her?

296
00:24:00.190 --> 00:24:01.650
How long have you got, mate?

297
00:24:02.108 --> 00:24:03.318
I know you hate me,

298
00:24:03.818 --> 00:24:05.820
but I wouldn't be here
if it wasn't necessary.

299
00:24:10.951 --> 00:24:12.077
I'll let you live.

300
00:24:12.535 --> 00:24:13.536
For now.

301
00:24:19.876 --> 00:24:21.294
I like him.

302
00:24:32.555 --> 00:24:33.723
Come on.

303
00:24:38.603 --> 00:24:40.605
<i>Ungrateful witch!</i>

304
00:24:40.897 --> 00:24:42.291
<i>I will exact vengeance on you, daughter.</i>

305
00:24:42.315 --> 00:24:43.358
No.

306
00:24:43.441 --> 00:24:45.443
- I won't let you.
- Release me!

307
00:24:45.902 --> 00:24:46.987
Never.

308
00:24:49.364 --> 00:24:53.660
It's only a matter of time now,
little bird.

309
00:24:55.453 --> 00:24:57.872
Only a matter of time.

310
00:24:59.749 --> 00:25:01.751
You're not getting out, Father.

311
00:25:01.835 --> 00:25:03.962
I have the will to do what must be done.

312
00:25:09.634 --> 00:25:11.219
Impudent daughter!

313
00:25:11.636 --> 00:25:14.681
If you die, I am trapped in this hell.

314
00:25:15.223 --> 00:25:16.307
Free me!

315
00:25:16.641 --> 00:25:18.977
Remember what I told you.

316
00:25:19.602 --> 00:25:23.523
Release me, or I will kill the boy.

317
00:25:32.532 --> 00:25:34.159
Is there a way to cure her?

318
00:25:37.037 --> 00:25:39.914
You get Trigon out,
and yeah, she'd recover,

319
00:25:39.998 --> 00:25:41.708
- but...
- But he destroys the world.

320
00:25:50.842 --> 00:25:52.177
Did you get any rest?

321
00:25:52.302 --> 00:25:53.302
Enough.

322
00:25:53.970 --> 00:25:54.971
Then come with me.

323
00:25:58.308 --> 00:25:59.434
You too, Kent.

324
00:26:00.685 --> 00:26:03.521
I want you to see what this war
has cost my family.

325
00:26:06.441 --> 00:26:09.194
Steal anything
and I'll cut your hands off.

326
00:26:13.823 --> 00:26:16.117
Oh, I really like him.

327
00:26:22.082 --> 00:26:24.363
I feared your plan
would fail from the beginning.

328
00:26:24.918 --> 00:26:27.087
An army without killers
is no army at all.

329
00:26:27.754 --> 00:26:29.339
But Batman believed in you.

330
00:26:30.924 --> 00:26:32.592
You cost me my father.

331
00:26:33.551 --> 00:26:34.886
<i>And my teammates.</i>

332
00:26:39.140 --> 00:26:40.391
<i>I won't forgive that.</i>

333
00:26:57.617 --> 00:26:58.617
Argh!

334
00:27:07.210 --> 00:27:10.255
Nightwing convinced me
not to voice my many objections.

335
00:27:11.131 --> 00:27:13.299
"There are always risks
in war," he said.

336
00:27:16.678 --> 00:27:18.263
He's not saying that anymore.

337
00:27:30.441 --> 00:27:31.985
You used the Lazarus Pit.

338
00:27:32.527 --> 00:27:33.611
You said you wouldn't.

339
00:27:34.654 --> 00:27:35.780
You promised.

340
00:27:37.949 --> 00:27:39.367
He was my brother.

341
00:27:39.826 --> 00:27:41.452
I had to take the chance.

342
00:27:44.455 --> 00:27:45.707
It just didn't work.

343
00:27:47.458 --> 00:27:50.879
We can't let what happened
to Dick and everyone else be in vain.

344
00:27:52.005 --> 00:27:53.214
Help us fix things.

345
00:27:53.798 --> 00:27:56.134
How? You're powerless now.

346
00:27:56.467 --> 00:27:58.219
We need you to get through to Batman.

347
00:27:58.887 --> 00:28:00.889
You can break Darkseid's programming.

348
00:28:01.431 --> 00:28:04.767
You grossly overestimate
the influence I have on my father.

349
00:28:05.852 --> 00:28:07.353
Batman cares about you.

350
00:28:09.105 --> 00:28:11.441
Even awful parents
care about their kids.

351
00:28:12.525 --> 00:28:13.526
I should know.

352
00:28:14.444 --> 00:28:16.725
I was there when Bruce
learned about Dick's death.

353
00:28:17.113 --> 00:28:18.114
It affected him.

354
00:28:18.406 --> 00:28:19.532
It almost got through.

355
00:28:22.785 --> 00:28:24.954
He overcame
my mother's brainwashing once.

356
00:28:26.289 --> 00:28:28.499
If anyone could
survive Darkseid's programming,

357
00:28:28.875 --> 00:28:29.876
it'd be Father.

358
00:28:30.752 --> 00:28:31.836
So you'll try?

359
00:28:33.546 --> 00:28:35.381
It's my responsibility to save him,

360
00:28:35.882 --> 00:28:38.218
or barring that,
kill him if he can't be saved.

361
00:28:40.929 --> 00:28:42.055
He would want that.

362
00:28:45.225 --> 00:28:47.286
But the only way to Apokolips
is to use the boom tube

363
00:28:47.310 --> 00:28:48.478
in LexCorp Tower.

364
00:28:49.020 --> 00:28:50.605
How do you expect to do that?

365
00:29:06.621 --> 00:29:07.747
You're getting worse.

366
00:29:07.997 --> 00:29:09.958
Great pep talk.

367
00:29:11.459 --> 00:29:12.627
Here, let me help.

368
00:29:17.882 --> 00:29:20.134
Lois said she was negotiating
with their leader.

369
00:29:20.969 --> 00:29:21.970
She's a people person,

370
00:29:22.053 --> 00:29:24.347
so I'm sure the situation's well in...

371
00:29:24.430 --> 00:29:26.057
...hand.

372
00:29:35.108 --> 00:29:37.360
Nice hook. Where'd you pick that up?

373
00:29:38.444 --> 00:29:39.487
I'm an Army brat.

374
00:29:40.154 --> 00:29:43.116
Well, no one out-brats me.

375
00:29:45.410 --> 00:29:46.619
Yeah!

376
00:29:48.079 --> 00:29:49.079
Lois?

377
00:29:49.455 --> 00:29:51.916
- Lois!
- She looks like she can handle herself.

378
00:29:52.041 --> 00:29:53.668
Come on, Harley, have at her!

379
00:29:53.751 --> 00:29:54.951
Nothing like having a cold one

380
00:29:55.003 --> 00:29:57.797
while a couple of fine sheilas
beat each other bloody, mate?

381
00:29:58.339 --> 00:29:59.339
Beer?

382
00:30:00.216 --> 00:30:01.718
Break her face...

383
00:30:02.635 --> 00:30:03.845
Clark's wife!

384
00:30:04.304 --> 00:30:05.471
Ugh, Brits.

385
00:30:05.638 --> 00:30:06.638
Aussies.

386
00:30:06.806 --> 00:30:08.391
- Poms.
- Convicts.

387
00:30:08.474 --> 00:30:09.475
- Wankers.
- Wankers.

388
00:30:09.684 --> 00:30:11.102
Do your best, honey!

389
00:30:21.988 --> 00:30:23.031
You've got to be kidding.

390
00:30:23.281 --> 00:30:24.324
Always!

391
00:30:24.907 --> 00:30:26.701
Harley, come on!

392
00:30:46.054 --> 00:30:49.891
I tawt I taw a puddy tat.

393
00:30:50.850 --> 00:30:52.202
Ooh!

394
00:30:57.357 --> 00:30:58.608
Way to go, ya beauty!

395
00:30:59.233 --> 00:31:02.987
And the winner and new champion,
"Luscious" Lois Lane!

396
00:31:08.451 --> 00:31:10.161
Captain Boomerang at your service.

397
00:31:10.536 --> 00:31:13.373
Have I mentioned that
I'm quite experienced "down under,"

398
00:31:13.456 --> 00:31:14.999
if ya know what I mean?

399
00:31:16.125 --> 00:31:18.252
No means no, Boomerang!

400
00:31:19.379 --> 00:31:20.380
All right, lady.

401
00:31:20.463 --> 00:31:22.131
Looks like we've got a deal.

402
00:31:22.382 --> 00:31:23.966
Listen up, everybody!

403
00:31:24.384 --> 00:31:29.347
Now we ride for Lex Luthor
in his fortress of bald-itude.

404
00:31:29.597 --> 00:31:30.848
So drink up,

405
00:31:30.932 --> 00:31:34.602
esteemed ladies and gents
of the Suicide Squad,

406
00:31:34.852 --> 00:31:36.521
because tomorrow

407
00:31:36.896 --> 00:31:39.690
we take back this planet!

408
00:31:47.698 --> 00:31:49.283
Why do you always lead with your chin?

409
00:31:49.409 --> 00:31:51.494
I learned from the best.

410
00:31:53.079 --> 00:31:54.199
Ow!

411
00:31:58.376 --> 00:32:00.461
Oh, bollocks, it's my ex.

412
00:32:00.545 --> 00:32:01.629
You and Harley?

413
00:32:02.588 --> 00:32:03.588
Gross.

414
00:32:03.923 --> 00:32:05.216
Do I look mad?

415
00:32:14.016 --> 00:32:16.227
How did Amanda Waller
let a lunatic like you

416
00:32:16.310 --> 00:32:17.854
become leader of the Squad?

417
00:32:18.646 --> 00:32:20.440
Easy. She died.

418
00:32:20.940 --> 00:32:21.940
Cancer!

419
00:32:30.450 --> 00:32:32.618
Sorry. It's a defense mechanism.

420
00:32:34.203 --> 00:32:37.039
King Shark is a shark.

421
00:32:39.375 --> 00:32:41.878
A week after that, my Puddin' died.

422
00:32:41.961 --> 00:32:43.754
Thanks to new Batman,

423
00:32:44.005 --> 00:32:46.382
who is no fun, by the way.

424
00:32:47.300 --> 00:32:50.970
So, me and my merry band of suicidals
decided to go freelance.

425
00:32:51.304 --> 00:32:53.365
We've been taking our cut
from Luthor's supply trains

426
00:32:53.389 --> 00:32:54.974
since this shit show started.

427
00:32:56.476 --> 00:32:58.728
We're real Robin Hood-types.

428
00:32:58.853 --> 00:33:01.355
Rob from the rich and sell to the poor.

429
00:33:02.148 --> 00:33:03.441
"Give to the poor."

430
00:33:04.108 --> 00:33:05.108
Huh?

431
00:33:05.151 --> 00:33:06.235
That can't be right.

432
00:33:07.487 --> 00:33:08.687
Do you have somewhere private?

433
00:33:08.946 --> 00:33:09.989
You need to see this.

434
00:33:10.281 --> 00:33:11.574
My office.

435
00:33:11.657 --> 00:33:15.411
We'll discuss everything
over my top-notch bottle of hooch.

436
00:33:15.870 --> 00:33:17.413
Now we're talking.

437
00:33:20.208 --> 00:33:22.001
No! I won't let you!

438
00:33:22.084 --> 00:33:23.084
Never!

439
00:33:25.505 --> 00:33:26.547
I think I need a minute.

440
00:33:27.590 --> 00:33:29.050
Is there a place we could rest?

441
00:33:29.425 --> 00:33:32.595
Oh, is that what you kids
are callin' it these days?

442
00:33:35.139 --> 00:33:36.682
Cheetah'll show you the way.

443
00:33:37.308 --> 00:33:38.684
I don't like kids.

444
00:33:39.018 --> 00:33:40.603
Sticky hands.

445
00:33:48.444 --> 00:33:49.444
Ah.

446
00:33:52.615 --> 00:33:53.909
Shut up.

447
00:33:57.745 --> 00:33:58.745
Sorry.

448
00:33:59.413 --> 00:34:01.582
Sometimes he gets so loud
I have to answer.

449
00:34:03.543 --> 00:34:04.877
You probably think I'm weak.

450
00:34:05.920 --> 00:34:09.257
Raven, you're one of
the strongest people I know.

451
00:34:14.095 --> 00:34:15.888
So, how'd you end up with Kent?

452
00:34:17.431 --> 00:34:19.016
You left and I was alone.

453
00:34:21.894 --> 00:34:23.563
<i>I just wanted to end the pain.</i>

454
00:34:48.004 --> 00:34:49.797
I'm sorry for not coming with you.

455
00:34:52.466 --> 00:34:55.219
When I asked you to join me
in leading the League of Assassins,

456
00:34:55.970 --> 00:34:58.139
I wasn't doing it
because you're a good fighter,

457
00:34:58.889 --> 00:34:59.889
I...

458
00:35:01.267 --> 00:35:02.560
I had feelings for you.

459
00:35:04.103 --> 00:35:05.855
If you didn't,
you made the right decision.

460
00:35:07.231 --> 00:35:08.608
It wasn't that at all.

461
00:35:09.191 --> 00:35:11.569
I left because my father
wants to kill you.

462
00:35:12.695 --> 00:35:15.615
After everything, I couldn't risk that.

463
00:35:35.426 --> 00:35:37.803
Darkseid's machines
have gone online in the Congo,

464
00:35:37.887 --> 00:35:40.473
China, and off the coast of England.

465
00:35:41.390 --> 00:35:43.267
What the heck are they?

466
00:35:43.976 --> 00:35:46.479
They phase the Earth's magma
into Darkseid's base.

467
00:35:47.897 --> 00:35:50.107
So these things must be destroyed.

468
00:35:50.650 --> 00:35:52.109
That's a temporary solution.

469
00:35:52.652 --> 00:35:54.487
We need to blow up Apokolips.

470
00:35:55.279 --> 00:35:56.656
Oh, is that all?

471
00:35:57.281 --> 00:35:58.281
Piece of cake.

472
00:35:58.616 --> 00:36:00.159
We can't brute-force this.

473
00:36:00.951 --> 00:36:03.329
On Apokolips, Darkseid has Paradooms.

474
00:36:04.080 --> 00:36:06.624
Parademons upgraded
with Superman's DNA...

475
00:36:07.667 --> 00:36:08.793
like Doomsday was.

476
00:36:09.335 --> 00:36:10.586
Don't rub it in, honey.

477
00:36:11.212 --> 00:36:13.923
We have to get them off of Apokolips
to have any chance.

478
00:36:15.216 --> 00:36:16.550
To do that, we plan on mounting

479
00:36:16.634 --> 00:36:19.095
simultaneous attacks
on two of the machines.

480
00:36:20.137 --> 00:36:23.557
That should cause the Paradooms
to be sent to Earth as reinforcements.

481
00:36:24.183 --> 00:36:25.601
Why not attack all three?

482
00:36:26.936 --> 00:36:29.188
We... don't have enough people.

483
00:36:30.815 --> 00:36:33.109
If the two teams do enough damage,
we'll be fine.

484
00:36:34.276 --> 00:36:37.071
The boom tube gate is
located in LexCorp Tower.

485
00:36:40.241 --> 00:36:41.784
That's where we come in.

486
00:36:42.243 --> 00:36:43.720
We take the tower.

487
00:36:43.744 --> 00:36:46.038
Our strike team transports to Apokolips,

488
00:36:46.372 --> 00:36:48.416
sets its power generator to go critical,

489
00:36:48.499 --> 00:36:49.792
reverses the boom tubes,

490
00:36:49.875 --> 00:36:52.044
bringing all the Paradooms
back to Apokolips,

491
00:36:52.128 --> 00:36:53.713
then we get out before it blows up.

492
00:36:55.005 --> 00:36:58.175
Easy peasy, rich 'n' cheesy.

493
00:36:58.259 --> 00:37:00.428
King Shark is a shark.

494
00:37:01.387 --> 00:37:03.681
Aren't you forgetting one small detail,

495
00:37:04.223 --> 00:37:05.683
name of Darkseid?

496
00:37:06.517 --> 00:37:08.519
"Warm beer, soggy chips" here is right.

497
00:37:08.978 --> 00:37:10.104
We can't take him.

498
00:37:10.646 --> 00:37:11.646
No one can.

499
00:37:12.148 --> 00:37:13.858
Darkseid is going to Oa.

500
00:37:13.941 --> 00:37:15.609
We only begin after he's gone.

501
00:37:16.402 --> 00:37:18.922
Once we're there, we shut down
the portal so he can't come back.

502
00:37:19.947 --> 00:37:22.450
Without Apokolips,
he can't destroy Earth.

503
00:37:23.534 --> 00:37:24.910
How do you know he'll be gone?

504
00:37:25.369 --> 00:37:26.746
Did you steal his diary?

505
00:37:27.913 --> 00:37:30.791
I have a source in Darkseid's camp
called "Sleeper."

506
00:37:31.125 --> 00:37:33.461
He or she has been slipping me
information for months.

507
00:37:34.628 --> 00:37:36.388
No wonder you and Kent are together.

508
00:37:37.590 --> 00:37:39.258
You're both gullible fools.

509
00:37:39.925 --> 00:37:41.385
Darkseid is playing you.

510
00:37:41.844 --> 00:37:42.970
Or Batman is.

511
00:37:43.763 --> 00:37:45.347
The information from Lois' source

512
00:37:45.431 --> 00:37:48.225
has led to every victory
we've had since the conquest.

513
00:37:48.893 --> 00:37:51.145
You have a strange concept
of victory, mate.

514
00:37:52.104 --> 00:37:54.940
The planet's molten core
will be gone in a week.

515
00:37:55.649 --> 00:37:56.942
Then it's game over.

516
00:37:58.444 --> 00:38:01.781
I know this plan has astronomical risks
and impossible odds,

517
00:38:02.323 --> 00:38:03.532
but we're out of time.

518
00:38:06.577 --> 00:38:07.828
Bla-bla-bla.

519
00:38:08.162 --> 00:38:09.955
Let's do this thing!

520
00:38:19.757 --> 00:38:22.134
Hi, we need your van.

521
00:38:30.684 --> 00:38:32.520
Ah, crikey, that's not right.

522
00:38:43.823 --> 00:38:45.199
Yeah, g'day.

523
00:38:45.407 --> 00:38:49.453
Um, yeah...

524
00:38:49.912 --> 00:38:51.789
My friend here was attacked by thugs.

525
00:38:51.872 --> 00:38:53.791
We killed 'em right back. Yup.

526
00:38:53.874 --> 00:38:55.417
Yes, siree Bob. You betcha.

527
00:38:55.501 --> 00:38:57.270
Gotta get my friend to a doc.
How are you?

528
00:38:58.212 --> 00:38:59.212
Can we go?

529
00:39:08.889 --> 00:39:13.060
Lord Darkseid, reports indicate
that the Lanterns have mostly fallen.

530
00:39:13.394 --> 00:39:14.394
Good.

531
00:39:15.688 --> 00:39:18.732
I go to claim Oa for my empire.

532
00:39:19.066 --> 00:39:23.195
Any remaining resistance
shall not be a problem.

533
00:39:25.614 --> 00:39:27.366
Do not interrupt me.

534
00:39:29.076 --> 00:39:30.160
Yes, master.

535
00:39:49.305 --> 00:39:51.932
It's Sleeper. Darkseid's gone.

536
00:39:52.266 --> 00:39:54.143
I'm sending the signal
to attack the machines.

537
00:39:56.020 --> 00:39:57.646
<i>China team is engaged.</i>

538
00:40:07.698 --> 00:40:09.366
North Sea team engaged.

539
00:40:09.867 --> 00:40:11.243
Orchid's with them, John.

540
00:40:12.411 --> 00:40:15.205
Wonder where she went
after she kicked me out of the house.

541
00:40:37.353 --> 00:40:40.648
<i>Why have the rebels been able
to stage these attacks on our reapers?</i>

542
00:40:41.190 --> 00:40:42.566
How the hell should I know?

543
00:40:42.650 --> 00:40:45.027
I don't do security
for the entire Earth.

544
00:40:45.778 --> 00:40:47.112
Isn't that your job?

545
00:40:50.074 --> 00:40:51.742
I say that with all due respect.

546
00:40:54.828 --> 00:40:56.997
<i>Stand ready to transport the Paradooms.</i>

547
00:40:58.707 --> 00:40:59.833
On your mark.

548
00:41:01.710 --> 00:41:02.710
What's wrong?

549
00:41:02.962 --> 00:41:04.814
I'm not getting a signal
that any of the Paradooms

550
00:41:04.838 --> 00:41:05.965
have left Apokolips.

551
00:41:06.382 --> 00:41:07.967
- Another debacle.
- Damian.

552
00:41:08.258 --> 00:41:09.301
We should have waited,

553
00:41:09.385 --> 00:41:10.904
we should have gathered a third force.

554
00:41:10.928 --> 00:41:11.928
This is my fault.

555
00:41:12.221 --> 00:41:13.221
I'll sort this.

556
00:41:22.898 --> 00:41:23.941
You here?

557
00:41:24.483 --> 00:41:27.778
I thought I'd pop by to discuss
fertilizer and the such.

558
00:41:34.785 --> 00:41:36.745
There you are, Swampy.

559
00:41:37.246 --> 00:41:40.207
You are wiser
than I give you credit for.

560
00:41:40.624 --> 00:41:42.584
Well, not a high bar, I gather.

561
00:41:43.377 --> 00:41:45.629
One day, Constantine.

562
00:41:45.796 --> 00:41:47.089
One day.

563
00:41:47.172 --> 00:41:48.424
You're leaving already?

564
00:41:49.008 --> 00:41:50.592
But just know that this thing here

565
00:41:50.676 --> 00:41:53.012
will be the death
of your precious Green.

566
00:41:59.727 --> 00:42:03.605
It... steals the heart of the planet?

567
00:42:04.023 --> 00:42:07.484
And you, you walking salad,
you didn't notice, did you?

568
00:42:08.027 --> 00:42:11.071
Just happy that half the people
on the planet are dead, eh?

569
00:42:11.405 --> 00:42:14.158
The humans earned their fate.

570
00:42:15.034 --> 00:42:17.619
By that logic,
the Green has it coming, too.

571
00:42:18.203 --> 00:42:20.789
Like humanity,
it was minding its own business

572
00:42:20.873 --> 00:42:24.168
and, oh, too bad, death sentence.

573
00:42:25.961 --> 00:42:27.546
The Green...

574
00:42:27.921 --> 00:42:31.175
will not die!

575
00:42:42.853 --> 00:42:44.480
Swampy's pretty pissed.

576
00:42:45.105 --> 00:42:47.399
That should bring down
the flyin' uglies.

577
00:42:49.943 --> 00:42:50.944
It worked.

578
00:42:51.236 --> 00:42:52.236
Harley, you're up.

579
00:42:54.656 --> 00:42:55.741
<i>And out.</i>

580
00:42:56.992 --> 00:42:59.995
No more planning, just doing.

581
00:43:04.208 --> 00:43:06.919
Is there no end to these minions?

582
00:43:22.518 --> 00:43:23.518
What?

583
00:43:29.858 --> 00:43:32.402
<i>If you're happy
And you know it smash a head</i>

584
00:43:33.695 --> 00:43:36.031
<i>If you're happy and you know it
Smash a head</i>

585
00:43:36.115 --> 00:43:37.315
<i>If you're happy
And you know it</i>

586
00:43:37.366 --> 00:43:38.686
<i>Then your face
Will surely show it</i>

587
00:43:38.742 --> 00:43:40.744
<i>If you're happy and you know it
Smash a head</i>

588
00:43:47.126 --> 00:43:48.502
<i>If you're happy
And you know it</i>

589
00:43:48.585 --> 00:43:50.254
<i>And you really
Wanna show it</i>

590
00:43:50.379 --> 00:43:52.798
<i>If you're happy and you know it
Splat the brains!</i>

591
00:43:56.218 --> 00:43:57.261
Best boss ever.

592
00:44:01.348 --> 00:44:04.434
King Shark is a shark.

593
00:44:09.398 --> 00:44:11.275
I need a cigarette.

594
00:44:24.371 --> 00:44:25.581
Rest well, Shiva.

595
00:44:36.133 --> 00:44:38.427
We sent the Paradooms to help you!

596
00:44:38.844 --> 00:44:41.221
<i>But, sir, they're eating everyone!</i>

597
00:44:47.394 --> 00:44:49.479
HR is going to be furious.

598
00:45:06.997 --> 00:45:08.415
Ah, we're sitting ducks here.

599
00:45:08.582 --> 00:45:10.167
I love duckies.

600
00:45:10.918 --> 00:45:12.336
Worst team ever.

601
00:45:12.794 --> 00:45:14.254
The boom tube gate is there.

602
00:45:14.338 --> 00:45:15.797
One floor up. No stairs.

603
00:45:16.465 --> 00:45:18.091
This way. Keep it moving, gang.

604
00:45:19.635 --> 00:45:21.595
You said this would be hard.

605
00:45:21.845 --> 00:45:23.430
It's not hard.

606
00:45:31.688 --> 00:45:34.441
I'm afraid you don't have
the proper clearance.

607
00:45:35.609 --> 00:45:37.277
Ah, bollocks.

608
00:45:42.616 --> 00:45:43.700
Damian!

609
00:45:54.544 --> 00:45:56.255
No one will mourn you!

610
00:45:58.257 --> 00:45:59.257
Raven, no.

611
00:45:59.800 --> 00:46:01.260
Stay in control.

612
00:46:04.346 --> 00:46:05.346
Huh?

613
00:46:13.313 --> 00:46:15.691
Can everyone stop trying to kill Luthor?

614
00:46:16.024 --> 00:46:17.024
We need him.

615
00:46:17.192 --> 00:46:18.986
He's a stinking collaborator.

616
00:46:19.069 --> 00:46:20.070
Too right, he is.

617
00:46:20.529 --> 00:46:22.569
Let me take a little off the top.

618
00:46:22.906 --> 00:46:23.907
Please...

619
00:46:24.408 --> 00:46:26.368
I was surrounded
and the battle was over.

620
00:46:26.451 --> 00:46:27.661
I had to make a choice.

621
00:46:28.287 --> 00:46:30.289
I've been helping Lois ever since.

622
00:46:31.331 --> 00:46:32.833
You're Sleeper?

623
00:46:33.250 --> 00:46:36.295
He's a traitor,
who changed sides when it suited him.

624
00:46:36.628 --> 00:46:38.547
What makes you think
he won't do it again?

625
00:46:39.798 --> 00:46:42.676
Because you need me
and you don't have a lot of time.

626
00:46:43.635 --> 00:46:45.345
Batman won't allow it.

627
00:46:53.562 --> 00:46:55.105
Abomination!

628
00:46:55.480 --> 00:47:00.110
You will stand no more!

629
00:47:12.205 --> 00:47:13.874
The Congo reaper is a loss.

630
00:47:13.957 --> 00:47:17.002
Concentrate the forces on the North Sea
and Great Wall reapers.

631
00:47:45.197 --> 00:47:46.990
Shazam!

632
00:48:00.545 --> 00:48:02.089
You'll take care of it, won't you?

633
00:48:03.924 --> 00:48:05.425
If my father gets control.

634
00:48:06.718 --> 00:48:09.596
You want me to add
your soul to my ledger?

635
00:48:10.764 --> 00:48:13.308
The spell has to be... ugly.

636
00:48:14.059 --> 00:48:15.936
My body has to be more than dead.

637
00:48:21.900 --> 00:48:24.569
The last accursed Dagger of Ostova.

638
00:48:25.195 --> 00:48:26.947
Good. That'll work.

639
00:48:27.656 --> 00:48:30.742
Keep Daddy in his pen
and we won't have to go down that road.

640
00:48:31.827 --> 00:48:32.994
I'm strong.

641
00:48:33.745 --> 00:48:34.996
I can do it.

642
00:48:46.007 --> 00:48:47.801
This thing's kind of stuffy.

643
00:48:48.176 --> 00:48:50.720
Hon, you wear two layers in the summer.
You'll live.

644
00:48:52.347 --> 00:48:53.807
My finest work.

645
00:48:54.516 --> 00:48:57.686
Fires Kryptonite-infused missiles
and high-explosive rounds.

646
00:48:58.437 --> 00:49:00.313
Perfect for Paradooms.

647
00:49:00.981 --> 00:49:02.732
But you made it to kill my husband.

648
00:49:03.233 --> 00:49:05.277
What can I say, I had issues.

649
00:49:07.946 --> 00:49:09.698
That's a whole lot of Kryptonite.

650
00:49:34.389 --> 00:49:35.724
We'll hold this end.

651
00:49:36.600 --> 00:49:37.516
Lois, you...

652
00:49:37.517 --> 00:49:40.061
Someone has to make sure
the portal stays closed.

653
00:49:40.687 --> 00:49:42.814
- But you need to...
- Hey...

654
00:49:43.190 --> 00:49:44.774
we're in this together.

655
00:49:46.818 --> 00:49:48.445
I love you, Lois Lane.

656
00:49:49.738 --> 00:49:51.031
I know.

657
00:49:53.617 --> 00:49:55.035
Now, go save the world.

658
00:49:55.285 --> 00:49:56.495
Touching.

659
00:49:57.829 --> 00:50:00.373
Now, can we leave before I come to
my bloody senses?

660
00:50:00.790 --> 00:50:02.876
Why are you still here, John?

661
00:50:03.168 --> 00:50:05.420
Don't exactly know, Clarkie.

662
00:50:05.962 --> 00:50:08.465
Guess I just want to see
how it all turns out.

663
00:50:13.720 --> 00:50:15.388
Come back to me, Smallville.

664
00:50:33.532 --> 00:50:37.452
That should help us blend in,
but I suggest we keep moving.

665
00:50:46.419 --> 00:50:49.631
<i>Luthor, there's been unauthorized use
of the portal from LexCorp.</i>

666
00:50:50.257 --> 00:50:51.925
<i>I want an explanation.</i>

667
00:50:52.175 --> 00:50:55.595
Just a power surge, Batman.
It's nothing, already handled.

668
00:50:55.720 --> 00:50:57.389
All hail Darkseid.

669
00:50:58.598 --> 00:51:03.228
<i>So, you've finally decided
to reveal your traitorous nature.</i>

670
00:51:03.895 --> 00:51:06.481
<i>Lord Darkseid will kill you slowly.</i>

671
00:51:11.069 --> 00:51:13.822
Well, I guess I'm completely
on your side now.

672
00:51:14.990 --> 00:51:16.366
Yay, team.

673
00:51:59.868 --> 00:52:03.038
<i>Lord Darkseid,
apologies for the intrusion.</i>

674
00:52:03.413 --> 00:52:06.416
I trust this is important, Batman.

675
00:52:07.292 --> 00:52:10.086
<i>We had an unauthorized boom tube
from LexCorp.</i>

676
00:52:11.212 --> 00:52:12.631
In brightest day,

677
00:52:13.465 --> 00:52:15.008
in blackest night.

678
00:52:18.637 --> 00:52:21.931
So, Luthor validated your concerns.

679
00:52:22.515 --> 00:52:25.435
No evil shall escape my sight.

680
00:52:25.852 --> 00:52:27.937
Send the Furies to capture the invaders.

681
00:52:28.313 --> 00:52:30.649
I will deal with them myself.

682
00:52:31.316 --> 00:52:33.818
Let those who worship evil's might...

683
00:52:34.152 --> 00:52:38.365
And also, teleport a portion
of Earth's magma here.

684
00:52:38.448 --> 00:52:39.949
I'd like to make a point.

685
00:52:40.617 --> 00:52:42.619
Beware my power...

686
00:52:43.536 --> 00:52:45.038
<i>As you will it.</i>

687
00:52:53.880 --> 00:52:55.924
Green Lantern's light!

688
00:54:12.041 --> 00:54:13.334
Diana.

689
00:54:14.335 --> 00:54:16.463
I'm so sorry this happened to you.

690
00:54:17.297 --> 00:54:19.090
To all of you.

691
00:54:25.096 --> 00:54:27.266
I have to say,
I don't fancy the new look, love.

692
00:54:28.016 --> 00:54:29.726
Makes you look a bit murdery.

693
00:54:42.572 --> 00:54:44.282
Kori, it's me!

694
00:54:44.824 --> 00:54:45.825
You're being controlled!

695
00:55:34.415 --> 00:55:35.875
Oh, shit.

696
00:55:39.879 --> 00:55:41.381
Easy, Princess.

697
00:55:45.426 --> 00:55:47.971
Finally, a challenge.

698
00:55:52.976 --> 00:55:54.227
Took you long enough.

699
00:55:54.435 --> 00:55:56.521
I like to make an entrance.

700
00:56:57.123 --> 00:56:58.708
And so it ends.

701
00:57:05.006 --> 00:57:07.258
My race is run.

702
00:57:08.384 --> 00:57:10.094
I regret nothing.

703
00:57:13.431 --> 00:57:15.058
It was fun.

704
00:57:22.231 --> 00:57:23.871
None of you will last long.

705
00:57:24.525 --> 00:57:26.903
You have no true warriors.

706
00:57:27.403 --> 00:57:28.821
You're right, Princess.

707
00:57:29.364 --> 00:57:31.032
We could use one of those.

708
00:57:39.332 --> 00:57:41.876
Oh, the old magic, that's the stuff.

709
00:57:42.126 --> 00:57:43.920
Cuts both ways, though.

710
00:57:46.506 --> 00:57:48.800
Hear me, Wonder Woman
of the Justice League.

711
00:57:49.133 --> 00:57:51.636
You are a paragon
for warriors through the ages,

712
00:57:51.886 --> 00:57:53.680
not Darkseid's minion.

713
00:57:54.055 --> 00:57:56.015
Break free, now!

714
00:58:06.234 --> 00:58:09.862
I am... Diana of Themyscira.

715
00:58:10.655 --> 00:58:12.156
Daughter of Hippolyta.

716
00:58:14.325 --> 00:58:16.494
I follow the old gods...

717
00:58:16.828 --> 00:58:19.497
and will never again bow to the new.

718
00:58:20.999 --> 00:58:22.458
Care to do the honors?

719
00:58:37.098 --> 00:58:39.809
There's a tunnel behind you
leading to the power generator.

720
00:58:41.227 --> 00:58:42.729
Leave them to me.

721
00:58:45.023 --> 00:58:47.900
Do not hold what happens next
against me, friends.

722
00:59:12.341 --> 00:59:15.178
Always keep the best one
for yourself, Lexy.

723
00:59:15.428 --> 00:59:16.929
Lex...

724
00:59:24.562 --> 00:59:26.272
Well, that's a problem.

725
00:59:27.148 --> 00:59:28.983
For Clark and the team
to have any chance,

726
00:59:29.067 --> 00:59:30.902
those monsters can't get
back to Apokolips.

727
00:59:31.402 --> 00:59:33.154
We have to hold them off.

728
00:59:33.863 --> 00:59:35.656
Last call, then.

729
00:59:37.533 --> 00:59:39.744
King Shark is a shark.

730
00:59:40.369 --> 00:59:42.538
Buckle up, Suicide Squaddies.

731
00:59:44.040 --> 00:59:47.335
Today's the day we earn our name!

732
00:59:59.305 --> 01:00:01.057
Oh, shite and fried eggs.

733
01:00:02.600 --> 01:00:03.893
My God.

734
01:00:45.184 --> 01:00:47.478
Barry? Barry!

735
01:00:48.146 --> 01:00:49.147
Clark.

736
01:00:51.107 --> 01:00:52.191
We thought you were dead.

737
01:00:52.275 --> 01:00:54.026
It was phased when Omega Beam hit.

738
01:00:54.861 --> 01:00:56.612
Apokolips reactor damaged.

739
01:00:58.322 --> 01:00:59.657
Converted me to replacement.

740
01:00:59.991 --> 01:01:01.117
Make it stop.

741
01:01:02.535 --> 01:01:04.537
You gotta make me stop.

742
01:01:04.620 --> 01:01:05.913
Let me.

743
01:01:07.832 --> 01:01:09.292
Sleep, mate.

744
01:01:17.675 --> 01:01:20.887
He caused it, the Flashpoint.

745
01:01:21.512 --> 01:01:23.181
What are you talking about?

746
01:01:23.931 --> 01:01:27.226
If he doesn't go back to save his mum,
Darkseid isn't here.

747
01:01:27.977 --> 01:01:29.645
But if Flash is the power generator...

748
01:01:30.521 --> 01:01:32.356
there's no generator to blow up.

749
01:01:32.648 --> 01:01:35.193
So we can't stop Darkseid
from coming back.

750
01:01:36.694 --> 01:01:38.154
Well, come on, then.

751
01:01:39.113 --> 01:01:41.449
Too far in to turn around now.

752
01:01:41.866 --> 01:01:43.326
We go through.

753
01:01:43.784 --> 01:01:45.912
What are you planning, Constantine?

754
01:01:46.120 --> 01:01:47.413
It's magic.

755
01:01:47.788 --> 01:01:49.165
You wouldn't understand.

756
01:01:51.334 --> 01:01:52.835
I hate magic.

757
01:02:20.655 --> 01:02:22.281
King Shark...

758
01:02:22.448 --> 01:02:24.492
is a shark!

759
01:02:35.503 --> 01:02:37.088
Come on, you bunch of assholes.

760
01:02:37.171 --> 01:02:38.422
Hey, you want a boomerang?

761
01:02:39.006 --> 01:02:40.424
Here! Come one, come all!

762
01:02:40.508 --> 01:02:43.052
What about you? And you!
And you have a boomie.

763
01:02:43.135 --> 01:02:44.845
You all have some fucking boomies.

764
01:02:44.929 --> 01:02:46.489
I've got you covered!

765
01:02:57.817 --> 01:02:59.193
Almost out of ammo.

766
01:03:02.154 --> 01:03:03.739
We can't let them through!

767
01:03:06.534 --> 01:03:08.077
Everybody on the platform!

768
01:03:20.673 --> 01:03:21.966
Ah!

769
01:03:29.640 --> 01:03:31.058
Can't do this long.

770
01:03:33.394 --> 01:03:34.979
<i>Raven...</i>

771
01:03:35.438 --> 01:03:37.106
<i>Let go.</i>

772
01:03:37.481 --> 01:03:39.066
<i>Trust me, daughter.</i>

773
01:03:40.651 --> 01:03:42.320
<i>Let go!</i>

774
01:03:59.712 --> 01:04:00.838
Raven!

775
01:04:01.589 --> 01:04:04.300
I'll kill you, boy!

776
01:04:11.140 --> 01:04:13.559
So, that was my dad.

777
01:04:14.602 --> 01:04:16.896
None can resist Darkseid.

778
01:04:24.445 --> 01:04:26.155
Hail Darkseid.

779
01:04:27.031 --> 01:04:28.783
I am the Source Wall.

780
01:04:30.242 --> 01:04:32.870
Lord Darkseid
has ordered you taken alive

781
01:04:32.953 --> 01:04:35.247
to personally see to your punishment.

782
01:04:57.269 --> 01:05:00.064
Please wait for Lord Darkseid's return.

783
01:05:00.147 --> 01:05:01.816
You shall be dealt with accordingly.

784
01:05:02.274 --> 01:05:05.152
Just stop saying "Darkseid."

785
01:05:05.486 --> 01:05:07.071
I must alert Lord Darkseid.

786
01:05:07.488 --> 01:05:09.299
- I am the Source Wall...
- What are you doing, Constantine?

787
01:05:09.323 --> 01:05:10.408
Techno magic.

788
01:05:10.658 --> 01:05:13.244
Feels like taking a test
you haven't studied for.

789
01:05:13.452 --> 01:05:15.663
Luckily, I cheat.

790
01:05:16.080 --> 01:05:19.750
Lord Darkseid... Lord Darkseid...
What is happening?

791
01:05:19.917 --> 01:05:21.293
Debugging ya, mate.

792
01:05:22.253 --> 01:05:23.295
It's gonna hurt.

793
01:05:42.314 --> 01:05:44.483
You've all
acquitted yourselves admirably.

794
01:05:48.487 --> 01:05:50.698
Excellent technique, Mera.

795
01:05:53.576 --> 01:05:55.369
Now, let's find our friends.

796
01:05:58.914 --> 01:06:01.542
What's going on? No! Stop!

797
01:06:02.918 --> 01:06:04.795
I'm fully integrated, Clark.

798
01:06:05.671 --> 01:06:08.424
There's not enough left of me
to ever leave this place.

799
01:06:09.675 --> 01:06:12.094
Now, listen, Batman stepped out
to talk to the big...

800
01:06:12.178 --> 01:06:13.804
Batman's returned.

801
01:06:14.305 --> 01:06:16.724
And with his lord and master.

802
01:06:18.601 --> 01:06:19.602
You!

803
01:06:27.985 --> 01:06:30.112
I knew Clark would come one day.

804
01:06:30.488 --> 01:06:31.906
It was inevitable.

805
01:06:32.531 --> 01:06:35.826
But I never thought you'd be part
of a lost cause, Constantine.

806
01:06:36.035 --> 01:06:38.204
I'm here to level the playing field.

807
01:06:38.621 --> 01:06:40.414
No running this time.

808
01:06:41.207 --> 01:06:44.835
Maybe Zatanna's loss
finally broke you. Ha.

809
01:06:45.211 --> 01:06:47.838
Was drinking yourself to death
not fast enough?

810
01:06:48.088 --> 01:06:50.799
You won't pick us apart
so easily, Father.

811
01:06:50.883 --> 01:06:52.885
You dare call me that?

812
01:06:56.096 --> 01:06:58.599
Your mother drugged me to conceive you,

813
01:06:59.475 --> 01:07:03.270
goaded me into raising you,
and broke me mentally.

814
01:07:03.646 --> 01:07:06.982
But once my eyes
were opened by Lord Darkseid,

815
01:07:07.066 --> 01:07:09.193
I see you were never my son.

816
01:07:11.195 --> 01:07:12.530
Only a burden.

817
01:07:13.864 --> 01:07:16.534
Don't listen to him, Damian.
That's Darkseid talking.

818
01:07:18.661 --> 01:07:19.870
Come, then.

819
01:07:20.496 --> 01:07:22.414
End your burden once and for all.

820
01:07:23.582 --> 01:07:26.585
Why is the whelp still alive?

821
01:07:27.378 --> 01:07:29.838
Correct this, Batman.

822
01:07:33.467 --> 01:07:36.303
Mobius Chair, attack protocol Alpha-Red.

823
01:07:39.682 --> 01:07:40.682
Shit!

824
01:07:48.440 --> 01:07:50.234
In the past, I let you win.

825
01:07:50.317 --> 01:07:53.279
This time... I won't hold back.

826
01:08:37.031 --> 01:08:38.532
Bruce! Don't!

827
01:08:50.544 --> 01:08:52.171
Finish him, Batman.

828
01:08:52.338 --> 01:08:56.258
Finish him and take your place
as first among my servants.

829
01:09:12.066 --> 01:09:15.611
You heard me, slave. Finish him.

830
01:09:16.111 --> 01:09:17.363
Hmm.

831
01:09:21.367 --> 01:09:22.367
Go to hell.

832
01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:31.960
You disappoint me.

833
01:09:34.338 --> 01:09:35.756
No!

834
01:09:37.091 --> 01:09:38.467
Damian!

835
01:09:46.850 --> 01:09:50.729
I am... free!

836
01:09:57.236 --> 01:09:59.154
John! He's coming!

837
01:09:59.530 --> 01:10:00.823
Do it now!

838
01:10:29.059 --> 01:10:32.438
Your bonds are loosened,
but not yet broken...

839
01:10:32.604 --> 01:10:35.607
until your oath to me is spoken!

840
01:10:36.150 --> 01:10:39.153
I'm offering you a willing magical host.

841
01:10:39.695 --> 01:10:41.363
Let's kill the bastard.

842
01:10:42.573 --> 01:10:44.950
I have a better idea.

843
01:10:51.165 --> 01:10:52.374
Bollocks!

844
01:11:14.313 --> 01:11:18.108
What's this?
What have you done, Kryptonian?

845
01:11:18.609 --> 01:11:20.778
Not the Kryptonian.

846
01:11:21.111 --> 01:11:22.863
Not anymore.

847
01:11:23.906 --> 01:11:25.657
No matter.

848
01:11:40.506 --> 01:11:45.677
So, you are one
of the so-called New Gods.

849
01:11:48.347 --> 01:11:50.057
I am unimpressed.

850
01:11:56.647 --> 01:11:57.815
Damian.

851
01:11:58.941 --> 01:12:01.318
Good to see you again, Father.

852
01:12:03.654 --> 01:12:04.655
Hold on.

853
01:12:04.988 --> 01:12:08.617
Dad, I know I wasn't the ideal son...

854
01:12:09.868 --> 01:12:12.496
...but you took me in and welcomed me.

855
01:12:13.372 --> 01:12:15.415
You taught me a better way.

856
01:12:15.499 --> 01:12:18.210
- And I thank you for that.
- Son.

857
01:12:18.794 --> 01:12:20.587
Remember, Father...

858
01:12:22.297 --> 01:12:25.676
...Justice, not vengeance.

859
01:12:27.845 --> 01:12:29.179
Save them.

860
01:12:29.763 --> 01:12:31.014
Save her.

861
01:12:42.234 --> 01:12:43.485
<i>Clark?</i>

862
01:12:43.569 --> 01:12:45.028
<i>Clark, are you there?</i>

863
01:12:45.487 --> 01:12:48.031
<i>Clark! Honey? Come in! Please!</i>

864
01:13:02.546 --> 01:13:03.714
<i>Clark!</i>

865
01:13:05.215 --> 01:13:07.509
- Lois.
- Bruce?

866
01:13:08.719 --> 01:13:11.322
<i>Forty seconds
to reach minimum safe distance.</i>

867
01:13:19.646 --> 01:13:21.148
I need to speak with Clark.

868
01:13:21.231 --> 01:13:22.774
There's not a lot of time left.

869
01:13:30.908 --> 01:13:34.161
Vic, send the message to
Clark's mech suit now, so he can see it.

870
01:13:34.661 --> 01:13:36.496
It's good to have you back, Bats.

871
01:13:45.213 --> 01:13:46.590
<i>Clark, honey,</i>

872
01:13:46.882 --> 01:13:49.468
<i>I know we planned on
always being together...</i>

873
01:13:50.344 --> 01:13:52.220
<i>but that's not going to happen now.</i>

874
01:13:52.554 --> 01:13:53.597
Lois?

875
01:13:56.308 --> 01:13:58.060
What is this?

876
01:13:58.727 --> 01:14:00.771
King Shark is a shark!

877
01:14:00.854 --> 01:14:02.397
King Shark is a shark.

878
01:14:02.481 --> 01:14:04.316
King Shark is a shark!

879
01:14:04.399 --> 01:14:07.527
And Captain Boomerang is
a boomerang, you fuck knuckle.

880
01:14:07.945 --> 01:14:10.989
It's been an honor
to fight by your side.

881
01:14:11.156 --> 01:14:12.741
Are you shitting me?

882
01:14:14.701 --> 01:14:17.621
Top of the world, Puddin'!

883
01:14:17.704 --> 01:14:20.165
<i>Ten, nine, eight...</i>

884
01:14:20.707 --> 01:14:21.875
<i>seven, six...</i>

885
01:14:22.209 --> 01:14:23.877
<i>You'll have to be strong.</i>

886
01:14:24.544 --> 01:14:26.213
<i>I know you can do it.</i>

887
01:14:26.296 --> 01:14:27.798
Lois?

888
01:14:29.257 --> 01:14:30.467
<i>I love you, Clark.</i>

889
01:14:36.098 --> 01:14:37.474
No!

890
01:14:54.741 --> 01:14:56.493
This cannot be!

891
01:15:00.122 --> 01:15:02.332
It is impossible!

892
01:15:05.085 --> 01:15:07.045
And now to deal with...

893
01:15:08.964 --> 01:15:10.215
You.

894
01:15:34.865 --> 01:15:39.286
You took everything from me.

895
01:15:39.411 --> 01:15:42.164
Now, I'm going to make you pay.

896
01:15:48.462 --> 01:15:50.881
You will do nothing but die.

897
01:16:03.393 --> 01:16:06.938
Unless I miss my guess,
we'll need Constantine.

898
01:16:07.606 --> 01:16:09.191
Well, that's a problem.

899
01:16:18.909 --> 01:16:20.327
Hello, John.

900
01:16:21.661 --> 01:16:22.954
Hey.

901
01:16:26.041 --> 01:16:27.709
So, I finally bought the farm.

902
01:16:28.710 --> 01:16:30.921
Easy as crossing a street.

903
01:16:31.505 --> 01:16:34.341
But how in the hell
did you get me into heaven?

904
01:16:35.884 --> 01:16:37.469
Pulled a few strings.

905
01:16:39.054 --> 01:16:41.014
I needed to apologize,

906
01:16:41.348 --> 01:16:43.433
for making you run away when I died.

907
01:16:44.309 --> 01:16:45.519
Remember?

908
01:16:47.270 --> 01:16:48.855
<i>Rebmemer.</i>

909
01:16:51.608 --> 01:16:53.276
A compulsion spell.

910
01:16:57.197 --> 01:16:58.448
Batsy.

911
01:16:59.366 --> 01:17:02.410
He thought we should have a backup plan
in case everything went wrong.

912
01:17:04.412 --> 01:17:05.997
Can you forgive me?

913
01:17:07.332 --> 01:17:08.500
'Course I do!

914
01:17:08.875 --> 01:17:10.961
I get to spend eternity with you.

915
01:17:11.711 --> 01:17:14.673
First question, are there any pubs?

916
01:17:15.006 --> 01:17:16.550
If not, we build one.

917
01:17:17.050 --> 01:17:18.468
Next time.

918
01:17:18.969 --> 01:17:20.887
Today, our friends still need your help.

919
01:17:23.390 --> 01:17:24.975
Oh, come on, Zee.

920
01:17:25.600 --> 01:17:27.185
I did my bit.

921
01:17:27.853 --> 01:17:29.062
I'm dead.

922
01:17:30.147 --> 01:17:32.816
John Constantine,
you of all people should know

923
01:17:32.899 --> 01:17:35.569
that means nothing
when destiny's involved.

924
01:17:42.909 --> 01:17:44.077
Damian...

925
01:17:45.787 --> 01:17:46.788
I...

926
01:17:51.209 --> 01:17:52.502
I love you.

927
01:18:03.930 --> 01:18:05.640
Goodbye for now, John.

928
01:18:19.946 --> 01:18:21.740
Holy shit, he's alive.

929
01:18:22.032 --> 01:18:23.408
How are you alive?

930
01:18:24.201 --> 01:18:26.161
I can't even be a corpse in peace!

931
01:18:26.369 --> 01:18:29.080
Wanking destiny can go bugger itself.

932
01:18:44.095 --> 01:18:45.764
You brought me back.

933
01:18:47.432 --> 01:18:49.267
I had to take the chance.

934
01:18:52.646 --> 01:18:54.689
Release me!

935
01:18:55.273 --> 01:18:58.068
Bet you wish you had taken
my offer now, eh, wanker?

936
01:18:59.861 --> 01:19:01.655
We're going to talk when this is done.

937
01:19:02.739 --> 01:19:04.449
Now, what's the bloody plan?

938
01:19:08.745 --> 01:19:10.330
Vic, do we have a way out?

939
01:19:10.413 --> 01:19:12.249
Working on it.

940
01:19:30.392 --> 01:19:31.559
Damian...

941
01:19:32.018 --> 01:19:33.478
those things I said...

942
01:19:33.812 --> 01:19:37.107
Don't make this overly emotional,
Father, it wasn't your fault.

943
01:19:37.565 --> 01:19:39.317
I've relinked with the Mother Box.

944
01:19:39.985 --> 01:19:42.988
I can transport you off the station
and bring back the Paradooms.

945
01:19:43.488 --> 01:19:46.157
Then I send Apokolips
to no destination at all.

946
01:19:47.534 --> 01:19:49.786
Darkseid is trapped
with his monsters forever.

947
01:19:53.873 --> 01:19:55.750
We're not leaving Clark behind.

948
01:19:56.001 --> 01:19:57.210
That won't work.

949
01:19:57.377 --> 01:20:00.422
Darkseid needs to be distracted
for me to do my thing.

950
01:20:04.217 --> 01:20:05.927
Yeah, yeah, let me think.

951
01:20:06.636 --> 01:20:07.929
Still pissed at you.

952
01:20:13.935 --> 01:20:15.145
You can't be serious.

953
01:20:15.228 --> 01:20:16.313
Uh-huh.

954
01:20:18.189 --> 01:20:20.650
On second thought, that's perfect.

955
01:20:21.192 --> 01:20:22.485
All together now.

956
01:20:33.705 --> 01:20:35.999
You have spirit, Kryptonian.

957
01:20:36.333 --> 01:20:38.710
But the strength
of a lost love is only...

958
01:20:45.592 --> 01:20:46.801
Go!

959
01:20:47.886 --> 01:20:51.473
Unless you would fight me
for the right to destroy him.

960
01:21:00.648 --> 01:21:03.485
And now, New God,

961
01:21:03.902 --> 01:21:07.072
let's see who shall rule...

962
01:21:08.531 --> 01:21:10.658
and who shall serve!

963
01:21:24.672 --> 01:21:26.883
Okay, bus is leaving.
There'll be no better time.

964
01:21:31.846 --> 01:21:32.931
Victor?

965
01:21:33.139 --> 01:21:34.474
Can't come.

966
01:21:34.682 --> 01:21:38.353
Download your consciousness
into a Mother Cube, or whatnot.

967
01:21:38.686 --> 01:21:39.997
It doesn't work like that, genius.

968
01:21:40.021 --> 01:21:43.149
Now leave, before these assholes realize
they're gonna be trapped here forever.

969
01:21:44.234 --> 01:21:45.235
Cheers.

970
01:21:52.033 --> 01:21:53.660
Go on, I'm right behind you.

971
01:22:06.423 --> 01:22:09.092
What a wonderful gift, daughter.

972
01:22:09.801 --> 01:22:11.177
Be well.

973
01:22:15.682 --> 01:22:17.058
Goodbye, Father.

974
01:22:21.020 --> 01:22:23.398
Looks like I get the last word.

975
01:22:25.358 --> 01:22:26.818
Suck it, bitches!

976
01:22:31.739 --> 01:22:32.739
No!

977
01:22:33.116 --> 01:22:34.451
You're mad!

978
01:22:34.576 --> 01:22:37.328
No!

979
01:23:44.020 --> 01:23:45.021
What news?

980
01:23:45.688 --> 01:23:48.399
Even though the planet reapers
were stopped before they finished,

981
01:23:49.150 --> 01:23:50.443
the damage was done.

982
01:23:51.152 --> 01:23:54.989
- How bad?
- We lost 31% of the Earth's molten core.

983
01:23:55.740 --> 01:23:57.742
The planet's rotation is compromised.

984
01:23:58.535 --> 01:24:01.746
The smallest change either way
will mean freezing or burning.

985
01:24:02.497 --> 01:24:04.749
My best estimate is
another billion deaths

986
01:24:04.832 --> 01:24:06.793
before we can get anything
under control.

987
01:24:07.877 --> 01:24:09.254
Provided we can.

988
01:24:10.672 --> 01:24:11.714
Okay.

989
01:24:12.924 --> 01:24:16.177
I know everyone's been through hell,
but we can't quit.

990
01:24:16.261 --> 01:24:18.680
The Justice League doesn't quit.

991
01:24:21.307 --> 01:24:23.601
If we work together, we can do this.

992
01:24:24.936 --> 01:24:26.854
We can save the planet.

993
01:24:29.941 --> 01:24:31.609
You know what you have to do, mate.

994
01:24:32.360 --> 01:24:33.695
Clear the board...

995
01:24:34.279 --> 01:24:35.572
start again.

996
01:24:36.447 --> 01:24:37.949
Another Flashpoint?

997
01:24:39.784 --> 01:24:41.869
I promised Iris before she...

998
01:24:46.457 --> 01:24:47.584
I can't.

999
01:24:50.587 --> 01:24:52.880
Yeah, figured you'd say that.

1000
01:24:56.884 --> 01:24:59.846
Everything would change. Again.

1001
01:25:03.433 --> 01:25:06.144
And some of those changes may be shite.

1002
01:25:06.603 --> 01:25:08.896
And we may make the same mistakes again.

1003
01:25:10.440 --> 01:25:11.858
It won't be perfect...

1004
01:25:14.360 --> 01:25:16.988
but it'll be a long sight better
than what we got now.
