00:00:16.184 --> 00:00:20.980
<i>Some days,
my childhood feels so very far away.</i>

2
00:00:21.731 --> 00:00:23.942
<i>And others,</i>

3
00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:26.361
<i>I can almost see it.</i>

4
00:00:27.404 --> 00:00:30.073
<i>The magical land of my youth,</i>

5
00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:35.370
<i>like a beautiful dream of
when the whole world felt like a promise</i>

6
00:00:35.537 --> 00:00:38.707
<i>and the lessons that lay ahead
yet unseen.</i>

7
00:00:40.208 --> 00:00:43.586
<i>Looking back,
I wish I'd listened.</i>

8
00:00:43.753 --> 00:00:46.256
<i>Wish I'd watched more closely</i>

9
00:00:46.423 --> 00:00:48.466
<i>and understood.</i>

10
00:00:48.758 --> 00:00:51.970
<i>But sometimes you can't see
what you're learning</i>

11
00:00:52.137 --> 00:00:55.014
<i>until you come out the other side.</i>

12
00:01:44.439 --> 00:01:45.857
Come on!

13
00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.000
Come on!

14
00:02:10.757 --> 00:02:11.757
Come on!

15
00:02:46.584 --> 00:02:49.254
I'm gonna miss out.

16
00:02:52.757 --> 00:02:54.551
I've seen this contest

17
00:02:54.717 --> 00:02:57.929
humble even the most
seasoned warriors, Diana.

18
00:02:58.179 --> 00:02:59.764
I can do it.

19
00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:02.892
Just do your best.

20
00:03:03.059 --> 00:03:04.310
And remember,

21
00:03:04.602 --> 00:03:06.896
greatness is not what you think.

22
00:03:07.522 --> 00:03:09.315
Pace yourself and watch.

23
00:09:19.810 --> 00:09:20.853
No!

24
00:09:29.445 --> 00:09:30.446
No!

25
00:09:30.738 --> 00:09:31.989
That's not fair!

26
00:09:32.823 --> 00:09:33.823
No.

27
00:09:34.075 --> 00:09:35.952
No. But...

28
00:09:36.118 --> 00:09:38.120
- You took the short path.
- But...

29
00:09:38.329 --> 00:09:39.664
- You cheated, Diana.
- No.

30
00:09:39.872 --> 00:09:40.872
But that...

31
00:09:40.957 --> 00:09:43.251
That is the truth.

32
00:09:43.417 --> 00:09:44.752
That is the only truth,

33
00:09:44.919 --> 00:09:47.004
and truth is all there is.

34
00:09:47.171 --> 00:09:48.482
But I would've won, if you didn't...

35
00:09:48.506 --> 00:09:50.383
But you didn't.

36
00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:54.720
You cannot be the winner,
because you are not ready to win,

37
00:09:54.887 --> 00:09:56.681
and there is no shame in that.

38
00:09:59.016 --> 00:10:01.477
Only in knowing the truth in your heart

39
00:10:01.644 --> 00:10:03.604
and not accepting it.

40
00:10:04.021 --> 00:10:07.358
No true hero is born from lies.

41
00:10:13.406 --> 00:10:15.074
Your time will come, Diana.

42
00:10:15.241 --> 00:10:16.909
When?

43
00:10:18.411 --> 00:10:20.496
When you're ready.

44
00:10:21.914 --> 00:10:24.041
Look to the Golden Warrior Asteria.

45
00:10:25.876 --> 00:10:28.879
She did not become a legend
out of haste.

46
00:10:29.046 --> 00:10:32.466
She did it through true acts of bravery.

47
00:10:32.842 --> 00:10:36.137
Like patience, diligence,

48
00:10:36.304 --> 00:10:39.307
and the courage to face the truth.

49
00:10:44.520 --> 00:10:49.400
One day, you'll become
all that you dream of and more,

50
00:10:49.567 --> 00:10:52.653
and everything will be different.

51
00:10:53.404 --> 00:10:58.409
This world is not yet ready
for all that you will do.

52
00:11:22.099 --> 00:11:23.726
<i>Welcome to the future.</i>

53
00:11:24.769 --> 00:11:27.688
<i>Life is good, but it can be better.</i>

54
00:11:27.855 --> 00:11:29.482
<i>And why shouldn't it be?</i>

55
00:11:29.648 --> 00:11:31.192
<i>Everything we've ever dreamed about</i>

56
00:11:31.275 --> 00:11:33.235
<i>is right at our fingertips.</i>

57
00:11:33.319 --> 00:11:35.738
<i>But are you reaping the rewards?</i>

58
00:11:35.905 --> 00:11:36.947
<i>Do you...</i>

59
00:11:37.073 --> 00:11:38.433
<i>...have it all?</i>

60
00:11:43.871 --> 00:11:44.890
Slow down, dude.

61
00:11:44.914 --> 00:11:45.914
No way.

62
00:12:00.179 --> 00:12:01.347
Dude!

63
00:12:01.806 --> 00:12:03.724
<i>Welcome to
Black Gold Cooperative.</i>

64
00:12:03.891 --> 00:12:05.611
- Oh, my gosh. Guys!
<i>- The first oil company</i>

65
00:12:05.726 --> 00:12:07.728
<i>run for the people, by the people.</i>

66
00:12:08.020 --> 00:12:09.438
<i>Think about finally having</i>

67
00:12:09.605 --> 00:12:11.649
<i>everything you've always wished for.</i>

68
00:12:11.732 --> 00:12:12.812
Let's go!

69
00:12:12.858 --> 00:12:14.193
Hey!

70
00:12:16.362 --> 00:12:17.642
<i>For a low monthly fee,</i>

71
00:12:17.780 --> 00:12:19.573
<i>you can own a piece</i>

72
00:12:19.657 --> 00:12:22.410
<i>of the most lucrative industry
in the world.</i>

73
00:12:22.576 --> 00:12:24.870
<i>And every time we strike gold,</i>

74
00:12:25.037 --> 00:12:26.705
<i>- you strike gold.</i>
- Oh!

75
00:12:35.047 --> 00:12:38.426
<i>No matter who you are,
no matter what you do,</i>

76
00:12:38.592 --> 00:12:40.886
<i>you deserve to have it all.</i>

77
00:12:41.637 --> 00:12:44.807
<i>Do you have everything
you've ever wanted?</i>

78
00:12:45.141 --> 00:12:48.394
<i>Aren't you tired of
always wishing you had more?</i>

79
00:12:48.561 --> 00:12:50.771
- Hey, move it. It's my turn.
<i>- Join me today.</i>

80
00:12:50.938 --> 00:12:52.565
- Yes!
<i>- Operators are standing by.</i>

81
00:12:53.149 --> 00:12:56.986
<i>You don't need a pile of money
or some business degree to get started.</i>

82
00:12:57.278 --> 00:12:59.321
<i>You don't even have to work hard for it.</i>

83
00:12:59.405 --> 00:13:01.282
Good morning.

84
00:13:01.449 --> 00:13:03.169
- Good morning.
- Don't even think about it.

85
00:13:03.284 --> 00:13:05.953
<i>At Black Gold Cooperative,
all you need</i>

86
00:13:06.203 --> 00:13:07.746
<i>is to want it!</i>

87
00:13:12.084 --> 00:13:14.545
We get what we want, and we go.

88
00:13:14.962 --> 00:13:17.042
- What do you want?
- None of this junk.

89
00:13:17.339 --> 00:13:18.507
Word is on the street

90
00:13:18.674 --> 00:13:21.394
you got a nice little black market
side business going on back there.

91
00:13:21.886 --> 00:13:23.596
If you don't tell, we won't tell.

92
00:13:26.348 --> 00:13:28.934
Yes, yes, yes!

93
00:13:32.104 --> 00:13:34.523
Oh, thank you.
Thank you. Thank you.

94
00:13:36.108 --> 00:13:38.152
Yes, yes, yes!

95
00:13:52.750 --> 00:13:54.418
Sir, are you all right?

96
00:13:55.294 --> 00:13:56.294
Gun!

97
00:13:56.337 --> 00:13:57.963
He's got a gun!

98
00:13:58.130 --> 00:14:00.257
Shut up! Please!

99
00:14:01.550 --> 00:14:03.028
Come on, dude. Can't hide.
Let's get out of here!

100
00:14:03.052 --> 00:14:04.678
Stop! Mall Security!

101
00:14:04.845 --> 00:14:06.430
No, no, you, you, right there!

102
00:14:06.597 --> 00:14:08.516
Right there! Freeze. Stop!

103
00:14:08.682 --> 00:14:09.743
Move, move, move!

104
00:14:09.767 --> 00:14:11.367
Chief, they're running up the escalator.

105
00:14:11.727 --> 00:14:13.312
Hey! Stop! Freeze!

106
00:14:13.979 --> 00:14:14.980
Freeze!

107
00:14:15.147 --> 00:14:16.190
No!

108
00:14:20.152 --> 00:14:22.130
We have
several armed assailants running free.

109
00:14:22.154 --> 00:14:24.031
We need the police here, right now.

110
00:14:26.450 --> 00:14:28.494
Freeze!

111
00:14:29.828 --> 00:14:31.247
Freeze! Freeze!

112
00:14:31.664 --> 00:14:33.499
Whoa, whoa! Hey.
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

113
00:14:33.832 --> 00:14:35.209
No. Dude, dude, calm...

114
00:14:35.459 --> 00:14:37.062
- Get back, man. I'll do it!
- Hey!

115
00:14:37.086 --> 00:14:38.086
Hey, what are you doing?

116
00:14:38.212 --> 00:14:39.128
It's okay.
It's gonna be okay.

117
00:14:39.129 --> 00:14:40.607
What are you doing?

118
00:14:42.216 --> 00:14:43.509
Hey, what are you doing?

119
00:14:43.676 --> 00:14:45.219
- I'm not going back!
- No, no, no!

120
00:14:46.554 --> 00:14:47.906
Just chill out. Just chill.

121
00:14:47.930 --> 00:14:49.974
- Stand back!
- Don't do it!

122
00:14:50.140 --> 00:14:51.725
No, no, no!

123
00:14:51.892 --> 00:14:53.435
Put the kid back.

124
00:14:53.811 --> 00:14:55.229
Listen to me.

125
00:14:55.396 --> 00:14:57.022
Listen to me!

126
00:14:57.773 --> 00:14:58.899
- No!
- What are you doing?

127
00:14:59.149 --> 00:15:01.110
Pull her back.
Pull her back in!

128
00:15:01.652 --> 00:15:02.653
I'm not going back!

129
00:15:02.903 --> 00:15:03.903
No!

130
00:15:04.071 --> 00:15:05.071
Gonna let her go!

131
00:15:05.281 --> 00:15:06.657
- No, no, no!
- No, no!

132
00:15:14.790 --> 00:15:15.791
What? Who? What?

133
00:15:27.803 --> 00:15:29.263
We won't be doing that today.

134
00:15:45.529 --> 00:15:46.739
Whoa.

135
00:15:54.747 --> 00:15:56.165
We... We... We should go...

136
00:15:56.498 --> 00:15:58.917
Oh, my gosh!

137
00:16:00.336 --> 00:16:01.712
Hold tight.

138
00:16:12.806 --> 00:16:13.849
I hate guns.

139
00:16:14.308 --> 00:16:15.809
We've got to go now. Come on.

140
00:16:45.089 --> 00:16:46.507
Yo.

141
00:16:48.008 --> 00:16:49.843
I'm sorry, lady.

142
00:16:50.094 --> 00:16:51.454
- Shh.
- I'm sorry. Okay?

143
00:16:51.804 --> 00:16:53.055
It was his idea.

144
00:17:03.399 --> 00:17:05.680
<i>And the authorities
still have questions.</i>

145
00:17:05.734 --> 00:17:08.195
<i>In fact, the first is a real doozy,
which is,</i>

146
00:17:08.362 --> 00:17:10.948
<i>who exactly even stopped this crime?</i>

147
00:17:11.240 --> 00:17:13.575
If the story around here
is to be believed,

148
00:17:13.742 --> 00:17:15.577
it wasn't the police,

149
00:17:15.744 --> 00:17:18.622
but a mysterious female savior

150
00:17:18.789 --> 00:17:20.416
that multiple witnesses saw.

151
00:17:20.541 --> 00:17:22.876
<i>If this sounds familiar, it should.</i>

152
00:17:23.544 --> 00:17:26.797
<i>We've now had more than
a half-dozen similar sightings</i>

153
00:17:26.964 --> 00:17:30.426
<i>across the greater D. C. area
in the last year.</i>

154
00:17:30.592 --> 00:17:33.220
<i>Which, of course,
begs the biggest question of today,</i>

155
00:17:33.387 --> 00:17:35.431
<i>who is this woman</i>

156
00:17:35.597 --> 00:17:37.766
<i>and where did she come from?</i>

157
00:18:54.843 --> 00:18:57.095
Excuse me.
Are you waiting for someone?

158
00:18:57.262 --> 00:18:59.348
No. Just me.

159
00:19:17.616 --> 00:19:18.909
Taxi!

160
00:19:25.874 --> 00:19:27.417
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't see you there.

161
00:19:27.960 --> 00:19:30.337
Hey, we could share, if you like?

162
00:19:30.504 --> 00:19:32.714
No, thanks. I'll wait.

163
00:20:16.967 --> 00:20:18.635
Oh, my.

164
00:20:22.097 --> 00:20:23.557
- Yeah.
- Hey, Jake.

165
00:20:23.891 --> 00:20:25.350
Jake, hi. Can you...

166
00:20:29.688 --> 00:20:33.483
Hi. I know, walk much?
The latch of my...

167
00:20:37.279 --> 00:20:38.322
Good morning.

168
00:20:39.114 --> 00:20:40.824
Hi. Thank you.

169
00:20:40.991 --> 00:20:44.494
Diana Prince,
cultural anthropology and archaeology.

170
00:20:44.661 --> 00:20:47.164
Barbara Minerva.
Geology, gemology, lithology,

171
00:20:47.331 --> 00:20:48.665
and part-time cryptozoologist.

172
00:20:48.832 --> 00:20:49.790
Oh, wow.

173
00:20:49.791 --> 00:20:51.753
I kept busy in college.

174
00:20:54.671 --> 00:20:57.549
Sorry. It's these heels, you know.
It's stupid.

175
00:20:57.883 --> 00:21:00.028
I don't know why I was gonna wear heels.
Scientists don't wear heels.

176
00:21:00.052 --> 00:21:01.470
- Sometimes we do.
- Right.

177
00:21:02.763 --> 00:21:04.443
- Right. Those are cool!
- Have a nice day.

178
00:21:04.765 --> 00:21:05.766
I like those.

179
00:21:05.974 --> 00:21:07.184
Animal print.

180
00:21:08.518 --> 00:21:09.686
Do you want to get lunch?

181
00:21:10.437 --> 00:21:11.437
I, uh...

182
00:21:11.480 --> 00:21:12.981
Not now, obviously.

183
00:21:13.148 --> 00:21:15.817
It's morning.
But later today, or whenever.

184
00:21:15.901 --> 00:21:17.361
Like, around... Like, at lunchtime?

185
00:21:17.986 --> 00:21:19.613
I have a lot of work today.

186
00:21:19.780 --> 00:21:21.949
- But maybe some other time?
- Oh.

187
00:21:22.115 --> 00:21:24.910
- Yeah, I'm busy today, too.
- Great.

188
00:21:24.993 --> 00:21:28.664
Ah! Diana, do you happen to know
who a Barbara Minerva is?

189
00:21:28.830 --> 00:21:30.415
Oh, hi, Carol. Hi.

190
00:21:30.707 --> 00:21:33.418
It's me. I'm Barbara.
Remember? You hired me.

191
00:21:33.794 --> 00:21:35.796
- Started last week.
- Oh!

192
00:21:36.088 --> 00:21:37.172
Gemologist?

193
00:21:37.506 --> 00:21:39.091
Yes. And zoologist.

194
00:21:39.257 --> 00:21:40.759
- We had a couple interviews.
- Yeah.

195
00:21:41.134 --> 00:21:44.554
Well, the FBI are gonna drop off
some artifacts later this afternoon.

196
00:21:44.721 --> 00:21:46.098
The FBI?

197
00:21:46.264 --> 00:21:47.975
- Yeah. Yes.
- They're coming here?

198
00:21:48.058 --> 00:21:49.351
The mall heist yesterday,

199
00:21:49.518 --> 00:21:51.645
apparently they were using
a jewelry store as a front.

200
00:21:51.812 --> 00:21:52.812
Front for what?

201
00:21:53.480 --> 00:21:56.525
Black market. Stolen jewels and art
meant for private buyers.

202
00:21:56.692 --> 00:21:58.836
But we could use your help
identifying one in particular.

203
00:21:58.860 --> 00:22:01.488
My help?
Yeah, I'll help the FBI

204
00:22:01.613 --> 00:22:03.281
with whatever they need.

205
00:22:03.448 --> 00:22:04.533
Is that a yes?

206
00:22:04.700 --> 00:22:05.993
Yes. I would, um...

207
00:22:06.159 --> 00:22:07.953
- I would love to assist you.
- Wonderful.

208
00:22:08.120 --> 00:22:10.122
It's nice to meet you.

209
00:22:10.288 --> 00:22:11.790
We've met.

210
00:22:12.916 --> 00:22:14.710
Have a nice day.

211
00:22:15.002 --> 00:22:16.128
Bye, Diana.

212
00:22:18.505 --> 00:22:22.134
Okay, item number 23.

213
00:22:22.718 --> 00:22:24.344
Shoot. That's not it.

214
00:22:29.641 --> 00:22:32.019
Oh, the Empress of Siam.

215
00:22:32.811 --> 00:22:36.314
Originally found in the wreck
of the <i>Nuestra Señora de Atocha.</i>

216
00:22:37.107 --> 00:22:38.107
Wow.

217
00:22:38.108 --> 00:22:41.653
Sorry. I couldn't resist coming to see.

218
00:22:41.820 --> 00:22:43.572
Oh, it's okay.

219
00:22:44.740 --> 00:22:45.741
Here it is.

220
00:22:45.907 --> 00:22:48.118
- What is it?
- Um...

221
00:22:49.411 --> 00:22:50.495
Uh...

222
00:22:51.413 --> 00:22:53.206
I can't tell.

223
00:22:55.876 --> 00:22:57.461
Some light.

224
00:23:00.088 --> 00:23:04.593
I think the technical term here
is "extremely lame."

225
00:23:04.760 --> 00:23:06.762
Um...

226
00:23:06.845 --> 00:23:09.181
It's... It's citrine.

227
00:23:09.473 --> 00:23:13.143
A classic stone used in fakes
throughout history.

228
00:23:13.310 --> 00:23:16.730
I can't imagine this is worth
any more than $75.

229
00:23:17.022 --> 00:23:17.938
What do you think?

230
00:23:17.939 --> 00:23:20.776
Fakes aren't my forte, but let me see.

231
00:23:21.693 --> 00:23:22.778
Mmm.

232
00:23:22.861 --> 00:23:24.237
Latin.

233
00:23:24.404 --> 00:23:26.044
At least
it's an antique, right?

234
00:23:26.073 --> 00:23:29.034
Or a purchase from a stall
on the Ponte Vecchio last week.

235
00:23:29.117 --> 00:23:30.994
- Mmm-hmm.
- You never know.

236
00:23:31.453 --> 00:23:34.706
"Place upon the object held

237
00:23:34.873 --> 00:23:36.541
but one great wish."

238
00:23:36.666 --> 00:23:38.001
You read Latin?

239
00:23:38.168 --> 00:23:41.088
Yeah. Yeah. Languages are a hobby.

240
00:23:41.254 --> 00:23:43.024
So maybe it's, like, a lucky charm
or something?

241
00:23:43.048 --> 00:23:44.091
Yeah, I guess.

242
00:23:44.382 --> 00:23:45.298
Strange.

243
00:23:45.300 --> 00:23:47.552
I really wish I had a coffee.

244
00:23:48.637 --> 00:23:49.637
You're funny.

245
00:23:49.638 --> 00:23:52.200
Hey, I got Erika a coffee, but she's
out sick. Does anybody want this?

246
00:23:52.224 --> 00:23:54.559
What? Yeah, I'll take one.

247
00:23:55.477 --> 00:23:56.477
Ooh, hot!

248
00:23:56.478 --> 00:23:57.598
Hot, hot!

249
00:23:57.646 --> 00:23:58.939
Did you see that?

250
00:24:01.483 --> 00:24:02.567
Oh...

251
00:24:03.652 --> 00:24:05.487
Can you imagine?

252
00:24:05.654 --> 00:24:07.697
- If only.
- Hmm.

253
00:24:09.699 --> 00:24:13.203
So many things,
I don't even know what I would wish for.

254
00:24:17.833 --> 00:24:19.793
I do.

255
00:24:22.546 --> 00:24:25.632
Well, um, anyway, sorry to bother you.

256
00:24:25.799 --> 00:24:28.176
If you need anything, I'm around.

257
00:24:28.343 --> 00:24:29.678
- Oh, yeah, I'm good.
- Yeah.

258
00:24:29.845 --> 00:24:31.138
But thank you for...

259
00:24:31.555 --> 00:24:33.390
That's okay. It's my job.

260
00:24:33.682 --> 00:24:35.493
And I'll look into it more
when I have a chance.

261
00:24:35.517 --> 00:24:36.517
Okay.

262
00:24:36.643 --> 00:24:38.812
Well, thanks for...

263
00:24:39.521 --> 00:24:41.940
talking to me.

264
00:24:42.107 --> 00:24:43.942
I'm... I'm sorry, uh...

265
00:24:44.734 --> 00:24:46.903
I mean, I'm fine.

266
00:24:47.070 --> 00:24:49.114
You know, we could go
and grab early dinner

267
00:24:49.281 --> 00:24:53.702
and talk about exactly
how lame that stone is.

268
00:24:54.202 --> 00:24:55.203
Really?

269
00:24:55.370 --> 00:24:56.580
Yeah, I mean, citrine?

270
00:24:57.038 --> 00:24:59.082
Who are they kidding, right?

271
00:24:59.332 --> 00:25:00.584
- So lame.
- Dorky.

272
00:25:00.750 --> 00:25:02.085
- Lame.
- Yeah, let's go.

273
00:25:02.252 --> 00:25:04.462
That's, like, the lamest of lames.

274
00:25:33.617 --> 00:25:36.286
Wow. You're so funny.

275
00:25:36.453 --> 00:25:38.663
- Oh. Thank you.
- Wow.

276
00:25:38.830 --> 00:25:41.750
I mean, no one's made me laugh like this
in such a long time.

277
00:25:42.584 --> 00:25:44.628
I mean, it's true,
I don't get out much socially.

278
00:25:44.836 --> 00:25:46.338
You don't get out much?

279
00:25:46.504 --> 00:25:47.714
No, not really.

280
00:25:47.881 --> 00:25:49.424
- No.
- I'm sorry. I'm just surprised.

281
00:25:49.591 --> 00:25:51.676
Because you just seem like
the kind of person

282
00:25:51.885 --> 00:25:52.969
who's, like, always out.

283
00:25:53.136 --> 00:25:55.305
Like, people are asking you
to go out all the time

284
00:25:55.472 --> 00:25:57.515
and you live out. You're just out.

285
00:25:57.807 --> 00:25:59.768
Like, you never get in.

286
00:26:00.435 --> 00:26:02.812
You just seem
like you'd be really popular.

287
00:26:03.230 --> 00:26:05.150
And I would know
because I've never been popular.

288
00:26:05.190 --> 00:26:06.190
You haven't?

289
00:26:06.399 --> 00:26:07.692
You're so personable.

290
00:26:07.859 --> 00:26:10.153
So... free.

291
00:26:11.154 --> 00:26:14.407
I mean, honestly,
I gotta say that I envy that.

292
00:26:14.574 --> 00:26:15.574
What?

293
00:26:15.575 --> 00:26:18.536
You envy me?
That doesn't make any sense.

294
00:26:18.703 --> 00:26:20.121
Oh, my gosh.

295
00:26:20.914 --> 00:26:23.083
People think I'm weird.
They avoid me

296
00:26:23.250 --> 00:26:25.919
and talk behind my back
when they don't think I can hear them.

297
00:26:26.086 --> 00:26:28.126
I'm like, "Guys, I can hear you."

298
00:26:32.008 --> 00:26:33.677
Barbara, my life

299
00:26:34.469 --> 00:26:37.472
hasn't been
what you probably think it has.

300
00:26:38.890 --> 00:26:40.725
We all have our struggles.

301
00:26:41.017 --> 00:26:42.017
Yeah, we do.

302
00:26:44.479 --> 00:26:45.730
Have you ever been in love?

303
00:26:48.191 --> 00:26:50.402
Uh... Yeah.

304
00:26:50.568 --> 00:26:52.988
- A long, long time ago.
- Mmm.

305
00:26:53.071 --> 00:26:54.071
You?

306
00:26:54.072 --> 00:26:56.408
So many times, yeah. All the time.

307
00:26:56.574 --> 00:26:58.118
Often.

308
00:26:58.285 --> 00:26:59.411
So what happened?

309
00:26:59.577 --> 00:27:01.246
Where'd he go, your guy?

310
00:27:01.746 --> 00:27:03.248
He, uh...

311
00:27:03.957 --> 00:27:05.166
He died.

312
00:27:06.376 --> 00:27:11.381
But I still think sometimes
that I see him up there in the sky.

313
00:27:11.756 --> 00:27:12.799
He was a pilot.

314
00:27:12.966 --> 00:27:16.052
- Oh!
- He was all kinds of things,

315
00:27:16.219 --> 00:27:19.556
but he was great. It was true.

316
00:27:21.349 --> 00:27:22.642
I get it.

317
00:27:23.435 --> 00:27:25.729
Well, cheers to us.

318
00:27:25.895 --> 00:27:28.898
Wishing us better luck, I guess.

319
00:27:36.406 --> 00:27:37.574
Hey, Leon.

320
00:27:37.741 --> 00:27:39.159
Hey there, Barbara. Late night?

321
00:27:39.326 --> 00:27:40.660
Yeah. Going back to work.

322
00:27:40.827 --> 00:27:42.907
I wanted to bring this to you
while it was still hot.

323
00:27:43.204 --> 00:27:45.749
- Oh, you're too good to me.
- It's not a problem.

324
00:27:45.915 --> 00:27:47.250
Stay warm.

325
00:27:56.593 --> 00:27:59.512
Hey there, sweetheart.
You need some help?

326
00:27:59.679 --> 00:28:00.889
No, I'm fine. Thank you.

327
00:28:01.765 --> 00:28:02.932
'Cause, uh,

328
00:28:03.350 --> 00:28:06.478
you know, you look as though
you're having a little bit of trouble

329
00:28:06.644 --> 00:28:07.854
walking in those heels, huh?

330
00:28:08.021 --> 00:28:09.248
It's okay.
I wear these heels all the time.

331
00:28:09.272 --> 00:28:10.333
Hey, come on. Let me walk you home.

332
00:28:10.357 --> 00:28:13.234
- I'm not going home.
- Hey, I'm just trying to be nice here.

333
00:28:13.735 --> 00:28:16.154
Huh? Come on.

334
00:28:16.321 --> 00:28:20.158
Hey, hey. Hey, hey!

335
00:28:20.283 --> 00:28:21.576
- What are you doing?
- Hey, hey!

336
00:28:21.743 --> 00:28:22.786
Let go of me!

337
00:28:22.994 --> 00:28:24.764
- I'm just trying to help you!
- Let go of me! Let go of me!

338
00:28:24.788 --> 00:28:27.082
Let go!

339
00:28:40.387 --> 00:28:42.555
Forgot my keys. Lucky.

340
00:28:43.306 --> 00:28:45.100
- How did you...
- Simple self-defense.

341
00:28:45.266 --> 00:28:47.310
Used his own momentum against him.
I'll teach you.

342
00:28:47.477 --> 00:28:49.562
Honestly, it takes no power at all.

343
00:28:50.980 --> 00:28:51.981
Are you okay?

344
00:28:52.148 --> 00:28:54.609
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Good.

345
00:28:54.776 --> 00:28:55.944
- Thank you.
- Of course.

346
00:28:56.236 --> 00:28:57.362
Go home, okay?

347
00:28:57.529 --> 00:28:59.239
- Yeah.
- Good night.

348
00:29:38.069 --> 00:29:40.738
I do know what I'd wish for.

349
00:29:43.533 --> 00:29:45.827
To be like Diana.

350
00:29:47.036 --> 00:29:50.707
Strong, sexy,

351
00:29:50.874 --> 00:29:52.750
cool.

352
00:29:55.920 --> 00:29:57.964
Special.

353
00:30:58.816 --> 00:30:59.816
Oh...

354
00:31:31.140 --> 00:31:32.225
Oh, no! Oh!

355
00:31:32.392 --> 00:31:33.601
Sorry.

356
00:31:34.894 --> 00:31:35.894
Oh, it's okay.

357
00:31:35.895 --> 00:31:37.730
Barbara, thank God you're good in heels.

358
00:31:37.814 --> 00:31:39.232
Oh.

359
00:31:40.775 --> 00:31:42.902
- Hey, Barbara.
- Hi, Jake.

360
00:31:43.069 --> 00:31:44.904
Wow. Looking good.

361
00:31:45.071 --> 00:31:47.156
- Oh, thanks.
- Yeah.

362
00:31:47.323 --> 00:31:50.118
This is our Earth Sciences lab.

363
00:31:50.910 --> 00:31:51.910
Oh, Barbara!

364
00:31:52.245 --> 00:31:53.246
Hi.

365
00:31:54.455 --> 00:31:55.665
Perfect.

366
00:31:55.832 --> 00:31:57.393
I have someone I would like you to meet.

367
00:31:57.417 --> 00:31:59.836
- A pleasure, Ms. Minerva.
- Oh.

368
00:32:00.003 --> 00:32:02.297
Uh, it's "Doctor," actually.

369
00:32:02.922 --> 00:32:05.008
Um... Have we met before?
You look familiar.

370
00:32:05.174 --> 00:32:07.093
- Do the thing. Do the thing.
- No.

371
00:32:07.885 --> 00:32:10.638
Life is good, but it can be better.

372
00:32:12.307 --> 00:32:13.547
Oh, my gosh. From TV.

373
00:32:13.766 --> 00:32:15.351
Oh, my gosh. You're the oil guy.

374
00:32:15.518 --> 00:32:17.729
- "The oil guy." I'll take it.
- That's right.

375
00:32:19.230 --> 00:32:21.149
Mr. Lord is considering

376
00:32:21.357 --> 00:32:23.651
becoming a Friend of the Smithsonian
at the Partner level.

377
00:32:23.818 --> 00:32:25.528
- Oh.
- Which entitles him to a handful

378
00:32:25.653 --> 00:32:26.839
of private tours of our facilities,

379
00:32:26.863 --> 00:32:28.531
and he asked for you by name.

380
00:32:29.490 --> 00:32:31.993
- Me?
- Well, what can I say, Doctor?

381
00:32:32.160 --> 00:32:33.911
Your reputation precedes you.

382
00:32:34.078 --> 00:32:37.665
And apparently we share a passion
for gemology.

383
00:32:37.999 --> 00:32:40.418
- Wow, okay. We do.
- I'll leave you to it.

384
00:32:40.835 --> 00:32:42.420
Uh...

385
00:32:42.503 --> 00:32:44.922
Oh, let me just drop this off
in my office,

386
00:32:45.006 --> 00:32:46.758
and we'll go.

387
00:33:07.654 --> 00:33:11.032
Oh! Oh, gosh. Don't look in there.
It's such a mess.

388
00:33:12.950 --> 00:33:16.204
So, I thought maybe
we could start upstairs.

389
00:33:21.125 --> 00:33:22.960
I love that ruby.

390
00:33:23.252 --> 00:33:24.271
Oh, no. Be careful with that.

391
00:33:24.295 --> 00:33:25.814
- What?
- That's very...

392
00:33:27.882 --> 00:33:30.426
Hey, have you seen my friend?
Where'd he go?

393
00:33:30.593 --> 00:33:31.904
- I'm right here.
- You are.

394
00:33:31.928 --> 00:33:33.596
Thank God.

395
00:33:33.680 --> 00:33:34.948
Oh, wait.
You've got a little dust on you.

396
00:33:34.972 --> 00:33:36.241
- Sorry.
- Hey, good morning.

397
00:33:36.265 --> 00:33:37.265
Oh, hi.

398
00:33:37.266 --> 00:33:38.643
- Hi.
- Oh! Uh...

399
00:33:38.810 --> 00:33:41.145
This is the one and only,

400
00:33:41.312 --> 00:33:43.231
Mr. Maxwell Lord.

401
00:33:44.273 --> 00:33:46.025
It's him.

402
00:33:47.568 --> 00:33:48.611
Life is good,

403
00:33:50.029 --> 00:33:51.197
but it can be better.

404
00:33:53.116 --> 00:33:54.659
He's from TV.

405
00:33:54.826 --> 00:33:56.160
Oh, I don't have a TV.

406
00:33:56.327 --> 00:33:58.013
Well, I have a great relationship
with Sears.

407
00:33:58.037 --> 00:34:00.037
I can get you a brand-new TV
by the end of the day.

408
00:34:00.164 --> 00:34:01.582
Nineteen inches.

409
00:34:01.666 --> 00:34:04.210
- No strings attached.
- I'll stick to the one I don't have.

410
00:34:04.377 --> 00:34:05.753
But thank you.

411
00:34:05.920 --> 00:34:06.920
Okay.

412
00:34:07.046 --> 00:34:09.340
You're so generous. Um...

413
00:34:09.757 --> 00:34:11.342
Headline... Uh...

414
00:34:11.509 --> 00:34:12.509
Mr. Lord

415
00:34:12.510 --> 00:34:15.972
took a tour of the entire Smithsonian

416
00:34:16.222 --> 00:34:18.099
while considering partnership,

417
00:34:18.182 --> 00:34:19.851
and guess
what he decided to do?

418
00:34:20.601 --> 00:34:22.353
Give his entire donation

419
00:34:22.603 --> 00:34:23.688
to our department.

420
00:34:24.897 --> 00:34:26.816
He's announcing it
at tonight's Members' Gala.

421
00:34:26.983 --> 00:34:28.401
It's going to be an amazing party.

422
00:34:28.568 --> 00:34:30.128
I hope you have something nice to wear.

423
00:34:30.903 --> 00:34:33.030
I actually tend to skip these events.

424
00:34:33.197 --> 00:34:36.826
I find that our benefactors
with a true eye towards philanthropy

425
00:34:36.993 --> 00:34:38.703
prefer to stay out of the spotlight.

426
00:34:38.995 --> 00:34:41.247
To let the museum's work
garner the attention.

427
00:34:41.414 --> 00:34:42.414
I agree.

428
00:34:42.707 --> 00:34:43.708
Except,

429
00:34:43.875 --> 00:34:47.170
I like to party.

430
00:34:47.795 --> 00:34:50.298
Oh, my gosh. You're such a good dancer.

431
00:34:50.590 --> 00:34:51.775
- You like Latin dancing?
- I love it.

432
00:34:51.799 --> 00:34:53.426
I know that I'm a terrible dancer.

433
00:34:53.593 --> 00:34:55.070
No, I doubt
that you're a terrible dancer...

434
00:34:55.094 --> 00:34:56.739
No, I've got a hip injury
from high school.

435
00:34:56.763 --> 00:34:57.781
...the shape that you're in.

436
00:34:57.805 --> 00:34:58.848
Great, so,

437
00:34:59.098 --> 00:35:01.601
- thank you so much for coming.
- Oh, yeah.

438
00:35:01.768 --> 00:35:03.287
You know,
I really should be going.

439
00:35:03.311 --> 00:35:04.437
Thank you for the tour.

440
00:35:04.604 --> 00:35:07.774
I will have to see you tonight.

441
00:35:07.940 --> 00:35:09.901
See you tonight.

442
00:35:10.193 --> 00:35:12.820
Bye. Have a good day.

443
00:35:14.030 --> 00:35:15.072
I'll find you.

444
00:35:18.576 --> 00:35:19.744
What?

445
00:35:20.828 --> 00:35:22.455
I like him.

446
00:35:32.089 --> 00:35:33.299
Thank you, John.

447
00:35:38.346 --> 00:35:39.931
Ladies.

448
00:35:40.097 --> 00:35:41.974
Mr. Lord.

449
00:35:42.141 --> 00:35:43.141
Mr. Lord.

450
00:35:43.142 --> 00:35:45.061
Not now, Raquel. My supplements?

451
00:35:45.228 --> 00:35:48.856
On your desk, but Mr. Lord.

452
00:35:49.565 --> 00:35:51.442
Mr. Lord.

453
00:35:55.988 --> 00:35:57.532
Mr. Lord.

454
00:36:19.595 --> 00:36:20.721
Mr. Lord.

455
00:36:22.431 --> 00:36:23.891
Mr. Lord.

456
00:36:24.058 --> 00:36:25.058
Dad!

457
00:36:25.059 --> 00:36:26.059
How?

458
00:36:26.769 --> 00:36:28.563
How!

459
00:36:28.729 --> 00:36:30.064
It's your weekend.

460
00:36:30.231 --> 00:36:32.191
Yes, clearly.

461
00:36:32.358 --> 00:36:34.777
Alistair.

462
00:36:35.361 --> 00:36:36.487
Where's the pool, Daddy?

463
00:36:36.654 --> 00:36:38.322
It's not done yet, buddy.

464
00:36:38.614 --> 00:36:40.449
But it doesn't matter.

465
00:36:40.616 --> 00:36:42.243
You just have to be patient.

466
00:36:42.410 --> 00:36:44.620
I told you the pool,

467
00:36:44.787 --> 00:36:46.330
the helicopter,

468
00:36:46.497 --> 00:36:49.125
you'll have it all.
But remember,

469
00:36:49.292 --> 00:36:52.086
Rome wasn't built in a day, was it? No.

470
00:36:52.253 --> 00:36:53.880
Hasn't it been a lot of days?

471
00:36:54.297 --> 00:36:57.258
Well, it takes time
to become a great, great,

472
00:36:57.341 --> 00:36:59.594
number-one man,
like your dad is going to be.

473
00:37:00.803 --> 00:37:03.890
Are you lying to your son,
like you lie to everyone else?

474
00:37:08.561 --> 00:37:09.562
Simon.

475
00:37:11.230 --> 00:37:12.982
These offices aren't ready
for guests yet.

476
00:37:13.107 --> 00:37:15.443
It's over, Max.

477
00:37:15.610 --> 00:37:18.154
I don't want to hear it anymore.
I'm out.

478
00:37:18.237 --> 00:37:19.572
Alistair, go wait with Raquel.

479
00:37:19.739 --> 00:37:20.739
Simon.

480
00:37:22.366 --> 00:37:23.726
I know it's hard to see right now,

481
00:37:23.868 --> 00:37:26.829
but we are finally right at the edge
of turning this thing around.

482
00:37:26.913 --> 00:37:28.706
"Turning it around"?

483
00:37:28.873 --> 00:37:32.001
There is no oil. There never was.

484
00:37:32.168 --> 00:37:34.462
So how are you gonna turn it around?

485
00:37:34.545 --> 00:37:37.298
Get more sucker investors,
like me?

486
00:37:37.465 --> 00:37:39.050
- It's called a Ponzi scheme.
- No!

487
00:37:39.258 --> 00:37:41.469
I have a big...

488
00:37:41.552 --> 00:37:43.095
There's something in the works.

489
00:37:43.846 --> 00:37:45.640
And it's no scheme.

490
00:37:45.932 --> 00:37:50.061
Simon, we have millions of acres
of potentially oil-rich land.

491
00:37:50.227 --> 00:37:52.563
You have oil rights on land

492
00:37:52.730 --> 00:37:54.690
that everyone else passed on already.

493
00:37:54.857 --> 00:37:56.137
Now, it didn't take much digging

494
00:37:56.275 --> 00:37:57.401
to find that out.

495
00:37:57.568 --> 00:37:59.528
I should have
done some digging on you, too,

496
00:37:59.820 --> 00:38:01.739
Maxwell Lorenzano.

497
00:38:01.906 --> 00:38:04.867
Didn't take long to find out
you're nothing but a lowlife con man.

498
00:38:04.951 --> 00:38:07.161
I am not a con man!

499
00:38:10.581 --> 00:38:13.709
I am a television personality.

500
00:38:13.876 --> 00:38:15.169
And a respected businessman

501
00:38:15.336 --> 00:38:16.837
- with a plan.
- Come on.

502
00:38:16.921 --> 00:38:19.548
- With... With... With a great plan.
- Oh!

503
00:38:19.715 --> 00:38:22.134
"If you can dream it, you can have it."

504
00:38:22.301 --> 00:38:24.053
Something like that?

505
00:38:25.513 --> 00:38:27.932
You have 48 hours

506
00:38:28.099 --> 00:38:30.184
- to get my money...
- You're going to regret this.

507
00:38:30.351 --> 00:38:33.229
...or the FTC gets an anonymous report.

508
00:38:33.396 --> 00:38:35.314
- Loser.
- Simon, wait.

509
00:38:35.481 --> 00:38:37.775
Simon, wait.

510
00:38:47.284 --> 00:38:49.078
I am not a loser.

511
00:38:50.496 --> 00:38:51.706
He's a loser!

512
00:38:52.957 --> 00:38:55.626
And don't you ever believe
a word that man said.

513
00:38:55.835 --> 00:38:58.087
He's a liar...

514
00:38:58.254 --> 00:39:00.423
and he's wrong.

515
00:39:02.758 --> 00:39:06.637
And he will rue the day
he walked away from me.

516
00:39:14.395 --> 00:39:15.938
And you...

517
00:39:18.441 --> 00:39:23.112
You are going to be so proud
to be my son.

518
00:39:24.947 --> 00:39:26.824
Okay.

519
00:39:31.579 --> 00:39:33.414
You'll see.

520
00:39:35.875 --> 00:39:37.626
Everyone will.

521
00:40:21.837 --> 00:40:24.381
These are known for a terrific fit.

522
00:40:24.548 --> 00:40:27.843
Yeah,
I'm just not so great with heels.

523
00:40:28.219 --> 00:40:29.637
Just try them.

524
00:40:31.639 --> 00:40:33.641
Come out and show me.

525
00:40:34.391 --> 00:40:36.060
Okay. Hmm.

526
00:40:45.111 --> 00:40:46.445
They do fit well.

527
00:40:46.570 --> 00:40:47.571
Ah.

528
00:40:47.696 --> 00:40:48.696
Huh.

529
00:40:52.910 --> 00:40:55.162
- Yeah, I like it.
- You look

530
00:40:55.329 --> 00:40:56.664
amazing.

531
00:40:57.039 --> 00:40:58.249
Do you think it's too tight?

532
00:40:58.415 --> 00:41:00.543
I think it's just right.

533
00:41:00.960 --> 00:41:02.628
- Wow.
- Yeah.

534
00:41:04.296 --> 00:41:05.714
I'll take it.

535
00:41:25.109 --> 00:41:26.694
Hey there. How are you doing?

536
00:41:35.369 --> 00:41:38.080
<i>The animals are winding me up</i>

537
00:41:39.707 --> 00:41:43.794
<i>The jungle call
The jungle call</i>

538
00:41:44.170 --> 00:41:48.048
<i>Who-ha! Who-ha! Who-ha! Who-ha!</i>

539
00:41:48.174 --> 00:41:50.426
<i>In Xanadu did Kublai Khan</i>

540
00:41:50.551 --> 00:41:52.344
<i>A pleasure dome erect...</i>

541
00:41:55.139 --> 00:41:56.974
- Those shoes are incredible.
- Thank you.

542
00:41:57.141 --> 00:41:59.643
- What a beautiful dress.
- You look fantastic.

543
00:41:59.810 --> 00:42:01.353
Thank you so much.

544
00:42:10.988 --> 00:42:12.031
Dr. Minerva.

545
00:42:14.241 --> 00:42:17.661
You look breathtaking.

546
00:42:18.662 --> 00:42:19.788
Thank you.

547
00:42:20.456 --> 00:42:24.210
I... You know, we have to go to
these sort of things for work a lot,

548
00:42:24.460 --> 00:42:26.629
so I've probably worn this dress
a million times.

549
00:42:26.712 --> 00:42:27.713
Mmm.

550
00:42:27.880 --> 00:42:29.006
Um...

551
00:42:29.089 --> 00:42:31.717
Actually, no. I...

552
00:42:32.218 --> 00:42:34.053
I just bought this today.

553
00:42:34.303 --> 00:42:36.764
I never look like this.
Um, not even close.

554
00:42:36.931 --> 00:42:39.225
Took me a long time to get ready.

555
00:42:43.520 --> 00:42:45.439
Biotin.

556
00:42:46.357 --> 00:42:47.858
You should try it.

557
00:42:48.067 --> 00:42:50.319
Makes you glow like a teenager.

558
00:42:50.569 --> 00:42:54.782
Reverses the clock.
Never accept the limitations of nature.

559
00:42:54.949 --> 00:42:56.325
Yeah, no.

560
00:42:56.492 --> 00:42:58.744
Especially not a beautiful woman
like you.

561
00:42:58.827 --> 00:42:59.828
Oh...

562
00:43:03.207 --> 00:43:05.376
God, it's so loud in here.

563
00:43:05.542 --> 00:43:06.710
Yeah.

564
00:43:08.003 --> 00:43:09.713
Can we go somewhere?

565
00:43:10.130 --> 00:43:12.007
- Just me and you?
- Yes.

566
00:43:14.134 --> 00:43:15.344
Hmm... Your office?

567
00:43:27.147 --> 00:43:32.152
Oh, wow! Look at all of this stuff.
It's so...

568
00:43:32.403 --> 00:43:34.488
It's so beautiful.

569
00:43:36.240 --> 00:43:38.075
Like you.

570
00:43:43.789 --> 00:43:45.708
What is that?

571
00:43:45.791 --> 00:43:46.875
Um...

572
00:43:47.167 --> 00:43:49.503
Uh, it's nothing special, really.

573
00:43:50.254 --> 00:43:53.966
But the FBI did ask me
to help them identify it.

574
00:43:54.216 --> 00:43:55.301
Wow.

575
00:43:55.426 --> 00:43:57.279
Though it certainly
has me stumped so far.

576
00:43:57.303 --> 00:43:58.429
Let me help you.

577
00:43:59.388 --> 00:44:02.182
Max is here.
No need to be stumped ever again.

578
00:44:02.391 --> 00:44:05.227
I have a dear friend
in Roman antiquities.

579
00:44:05.394 --> 00:44:07.813
- Roman antiquities.
- Could give it a look, if you like?

580
00:44:10.316 --> 00:44:12.234
It is Latin, isn't it?

581
00:44:15.279 --> 00:44:17.448
I really shouldn't let it
go out of the museum.

582
00:44:28.375 --> 00:44:30.961
- Hey there, beautiful.
- No, thank you. Excuse me.

583
00:44:31.795 --> 00:44:33.172
Oh, Diana.

584
00:44:34.173 --> 00:44:36.091
Hoping I'd see you.

585
00:44:36.258 --> 00:44:38.469
Hey, do you know
I'm at the White House now?

586
00:44:38.635 --> 00:44:42.473
Yeah, that's right.
Interning, but requested by name, so...

587
00:44:42.639 --> 00:44:45.351
Listen, I've had my eyes on you
for some time.

588
00:44:45.517 --> 00:44:48.145
- So if you ever need...
- That's great, Carl.

589
00:44:51.565 --> 00:44:53.525
Diana.

590
00:44:58.364 --> 00:44:59.365
Diana.

591
00:44:59.531 --> 00:45:02.659
Excuse me, I don't even know you,
so please stop following me.

592
00:45:07.915 --> 00:45:09.708
- Good night.
- But...

593
00:45:09.792 --> 00:45:11.919
I wish we had more time.

594
00:45:17.216 --> 00:45:18.509
Why did you say that?

595
00:45:19.593 --> 00:45:21.261
Don't say that to me.

596
00:45:21.428 --> 00:45:22.888
You don't even know me.

597
00:45:23.055 --> 00:45:25.265
Yes, I do.

598
00:45:36.360 --> 00:45:38.779
I can save today...

599
00:45:38.946 --> 00:45:41.615
but you can save the world.

600
00:45:49.581 --> 00:45:51.500
Steve?

601
00:45:55.504 --> 00:45:57.297
Diana.

602
00:46:00.134 --> 00:46:01.885
But how?

603
00:46:02.052 --> 00:46:04.138
I don't know.

604
00:46:10.519 --> 00:46:12.104
Oh, my God.

605
00:46:14.606 --> 00:46:15.691
It's you.

606
00:46:26.869 --> 00:46:29.121
I missed you.

607
00:46:32.332 --> 00:46:33.959
<i>So what do you remember?</i>

608
00:46:35.002 --> 00:46:37.463
I remember...

609
00:46:37.629 --> 00:46:39.173
I remember taking the plane up...

610
00:46:39.256 --> 00:46:40.466
Mmm-hmm.

611
00:46:40.632 --> 00:46:42.384
...and then...

612
00:46:43.135 --> 00:46:45.679
nothing, really.

613
00:46:45.846 --> 00:46:46.889
Nothing.

614
00:46:47.055 --> 00:46:49.933
But somehow,
I know I've been someplace since then.

615
00:46:50.100 --> 00:46:52.603
Someplace that's, uh...

616
00:46:54.188 --> 00:46:56.940
I can't really put words to it.

617
00:46:57.107 --> 00:47:00.652
But it's... It's good.

618
00:47:06.658 --> 00:47:08.994
And then I, uh... I woke up here.

619
00:47:09.161 --> 00:47:10.161
Where?

620
00:47:10.162 --> 00:47:12.664
I ended up in a bed. Uh...

621
00:47:13.749 --> 00:47:17.920
Strange, strange pillow bed with slats.

622
00:47:18.086 --> 00:47:19.713
- A futon, yeah.
- A futon?

623
00:47:19.880 --> 00:47:21.089
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

624
00:47:21.256 --> 00:47:26.053
Well, not comfortable.
And really a bit backwards

625
00:47:26.220 --> 00:47:28.347
if I'm being really honest with you.

626
00:47:28.514 --> 00:47:30.766
I mean, for a futuristic time like this.
Nineteen...

627
00:47:30.933 --> 00:47:34.478
Eighty-four. 1984.

628
00:47:44.363 --> 00:47:46.823
That's amazing.

629
00:48:00.921 --> 00:48:04.716
Would you like to see my futon?

630
00:48:16.395 --> 00:48:18.063
Yeah. Um...

631
00:48:19.147 --> 00:48:21.275
You don't have to tell me.

632
00:48:21.441 --> 00:48:25.153
The place is a mess. Cheese on demand.

633
00:48:26.071 --> 00:48:28.699
I spent all morning
cleaning his bedroom,

634
00:48:28.865 --> 00:48:31.368
but he seems to me to be an engineer.

635
00:48:32.202 --> 00:48:34.621
Lots of pictures of himself.

636
00:48:34.788 --> 00:48:39.418
Not what I would do,
but to each his own.

637
00:48:40.544 --> 00:48:42.546
Oh, so this is how you found me.

638
00:48:42.713 --> 00:48:45.007
Yeah, the phone book.

639
00:48:45.173 --> 00:48:47.593
I guess some things
are just future-proof.

640
00:48:47.759 --> 00:48:48.879
So you went to my apartment?

641
00:48:48.927 --> 00:48:50.487
Yeah, I tried to use the bike at first.

642
00:48:50.596 --> 00:48:54.933
I couldn't really figure out
how to get it going,

643
00:48:55.767 --> 00:48:59.062
so I ran over and saw you come back.

644
00:49:00.272 --> 00:49:04.192
And I was stunned.

645
00:49:06.028 --> 00:49:07.362
There you were.

646
00:49:09.364 --> 00:49:11.575
So I just, uh...

647
00:49:12.284 --> 00:49:14.494
followed you, like a creep.

648
00:49:17.831 --> 00:49:20.250
Diana, look at you. It's...

649
00:49:20.876 --> 00:49:25.088
It's like not one day has passed.

650
00:49:25.255 --> 00:49:27.799
I can't say the same thing about you.

651
00:49:27.924 --> 00:49:32.804
Right, right, right. Right.

652
00:49:40.354 --> 00:49:41.813
Yeah, he's, uh...

653
00:50:08.632 --> 00:50:09.966
He's got it.

654
00:50:10.133 --> 00:50:12.678
No, I like him.

655
00:50:14.137 --> 00:50:18.433
He's great, but all I see is you.

656
00:50:38.745 --> 00:50:42.749
"One great wish." I've been waiting.

657
00:50:48.380 --> 00:50:51.007
I wish to be you.

658
00:50:51.174 --> 00:50:53.719
The Dreamstone itself.

659
00:51:52.944 --> 00:51:53.944
Hi.

660
00:51:55.697 --> 00:51:57.073
Come here.

661
00:51:57.157 --> 00:51:58.700
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

662
00:52:03.872 --> 00:52:08.251
Been eating Pop-Tarts all morning,
and I've had about three pots of coffee.

663
00:52:08.335 --> 00:52:12.255
This place is amazing.

664
00:52:13.507 --> 00:52:15.175
- This place?
- Yeah.

665
00:52:15.425 --> 00:52:17.594
You know, if I really think about it,

666
00:52:17.761 --> 00:52:20.514
I don't think I've ever been in a room
more amazing.

667
00:52:21.890 --> 00:52:23.391
- It's true.
- Yeah.

668
00:52:23.558 --> 00:52:25.519
This room is the most amazing place

669
00:52:25.685 --> 00:52:28.581
- I've ever been in, in my entire life.
- It's the most amazing place, right?

670
00:52:28.605 --> 00:52:31.942
So let's stay. We shouldn't go.

671
00:52:32.108 --> 00:52:34.277
- I really don't want to.
- So, let's not.

672
00:52:34.528 --> 00:52:35.528
- Okay.
- Okay.

673
00:52:35.612 --> 00:52:36.613
Let's just stay here.

674
00:52:36.780 --> 00:52:38.198
Let's just stay here.

675
00:52:38.949 --> 00:52:40.325
Forever.

676
00:52:43.537 --> 00:52:44.746
Although...

677
00:52:44.913 --> 00:52:47.707
I should probably go and figure out

678
00:52:47.874 --> 00:52:52.462
how a stone brought my boyfriend back
in someone else's body.

679
00:52:56.842 --> 00:52:59.052
That's a fair point. Let's go.

680
00:53:41.761 --> 00:53:42.846
Whoa.

681
00:53:57.152 --> 00:53:58.236
Mr. Stagg?

682
00:53:58.403 --> 00:54:00.155
Thank you, Belinda.

683
00:54:01.072 --> 00:54:02.073
Oh, God.

684
00:54:03.408 --> 00:54:05.535
You'd better be here with my money.

685
00:54:05.702 --> 00:54:08.705
I'll have your money, Simon.
Today, I'm here for an apology.

686
00:54:08.872 --> 00:54:11.249
Are you out of your mind?
I'm not going to apologize.

687
00:54:11.333 --> 00:54:12.334
I'm sorry.

688
00:54:12.709 --> 00:54:15.378
I messed up. I messed up.

689
00:54:15.587 --> 00:54:17.005
I lied.

690
00:54:18.465 --> 00:54:19.716
And I'm sorry.

691
00:54:20.550 --> 00:54:23.428
You know, the truth is, I knew
we were going to sink a long time ago.

692
00:54:23.637 --> 00:54:25.722
The wells were coming up dry.

693
00:54:25.889 --> 00:54:29.267
And no data suggested
that was going to change.

694
00:54:29.434 --> 00:54:31.019
I should have folded then.

695
00:54:31.186 --> 00:54:34.022
But all the people that bought in,
that believed in me.

696
00:54:34.481 --> 00:54:36.524
- I wanted to do right.
- Oh, come on.

697
00:54:36.775 --> 00:54:38.485
Max, look, you don't have to...

698
00:54:38.735 --> 00:54:42.238
Simon, don't you understand
that I wished for better?

699
00:54:42.614 --> 00:54:45.116
That with every ounce of my being,

700
00:54:45.283 --> 00:54:49.329
I wished that Black Gold
would change the world for all of us.

701
00:54:51.331 --> 00:54:52.874
And I know you wished that, too.

702
00:54:53.083 --> 00:54:55.585
Of course I wished that, too.

703
00:54:59.547 --> 00:55:01.424
Then your wish is granted.

704
00:55:01.633 --> 00:55:04.135
And in return,
I'll take all of your shares...

705
00:55:06.388 --> 00:55:08.390
and full control of Black Gold,

706
00:55:08.556 --> 00:55:11.351
after you are somehow
magically removed from my path...

707
00:55:11.518 --> 00:55:13.603
- You're gonna what?
- ...forever.

708
00:55:16.147 --> 00:55:17.899
Max!

709
00:55:18.066 --> 00:55:19.567
Hey, Max!

710
00:55:21.236 --> 00:55:24.072
- Get back here! Max!
- Ow.

711
00:55:24.531 --> 00:55:27.033
What the hell is going on?

712
00:55:33.581 --> 00:55:34.941
We have a warrant for Simon Stagg.

713
00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:36.459
My word. Are we in danger?

714
00:55:36.626 --> 00:55:38.503
No, sir. Federal taxation crime.

715
00:55:38.670 --> 00:55:40.255
It doesn't concern you. Move along.

716
00:55:41.339 --> 00:55:42.379
Send them through.

717
00:55:42.549 --> 00:55:44.634
- Okay. Follow me.
- Let's go, guys.

718
00:55:57.063 --> 00:55:58.063
Ooh.

719
00:56:00.734 --> 00:56:04.070
So you said a stone started all of this?

720
00:56:04.237 --> 00:56:06.448
Yeah, that's what we need
to go and find out.

721
00:56:06.614 --> 00:56:08.616
I mean, it must have done something.

722
00:56:09.200 --> 00:56:11.953
This is dynamite.

723
00:56:12.120 --> 00:56:13.121
What do you think?

724
00:56:13.371 --> 00:56:15.665
- Yeah. Yeah...
- Huh? Right?

725
00:56:15.874 --> 00:56:18.460
I saw a couple of magazine pictures.
They roll these up.

726
00:56:19.085 --> 00:56:20.920
I think we can do better.

727
00:56:21.129 --> 00:56:23.506
Look at all the pockets in this.
There are pockets here.

728
00:56:23.631 --> 00:56:25.026
There are pockets all over the pant.

729
00:56:25.050 --> 00:56:28.553
American issue bag, adjustable.

730
00:56:28.636 --> 00:56:30.388
Parachute pants?

731
00:56:30.555 --> 00:56:33.183
- Yeah. Uh...
- Does everybody parachute now?

732
00:56:33.349 --> 00:56:34.535
<i>You know, I'm not so keen on this one.</i>

733
00:56:34.559 --> 00:56:38.313
I figure you are, but you know what,
I'm ready to go.

734
00:56:38.396 --> 00:56:39.397
Mmm-mmm.

735
00:56:39.481 --> 00:56:41.149
- Right?
- No.

736
00:56:42.150 --> 00:56:44.444
- You're not even giving it a second.
- It's not good.

737
00:56:44.611 --> 00:56:47.113
"Too much" in a good way or a bad way?
Right?

738
00:56:47.280 --> 00:56:48.782
- In a bad way.
- Oh.

739
00:56:50.992 --> 00:56:52.118
Now that's great.

740
00:56:52.285 --> 00:56:54.204
It's beautiful.

741
00:56:54.370 --> 00:56:56.873
Yeah. I would absolutely never wear it.

742
00:56:56.956 --> 00:56:58.583
- I feel like a pirate.
- Steve.

743
00:56:58.750 --> 00:57:01.127
Who would wear this?

744
00:57:01.503 --> 00:57:02.587
Diana,

745
00:57:02.796 --> 00:57:04.047
have you seen these shoes?

746
00:57:04.172 --> 00:57:06.633
- Let's keep the shoes.
- Let's keep the shoes. Yes!

747
00:57:06.800 --> 00:57:07.960
- Let's keep the shoes.
- Yes!

748
00:57:17.644 --> 00:57:20.021
This is a special one, okay?

749
00:57:20.188 --> 00:57:22.190
- Let's do this together.
- Uh-huh.

750
00:57:24.025 --> 00:57:26.444
One foot after the other.

751
00:57:26.611 --> 00:57:28.279
Now stay on this one.

752
00:57:28.530 --> 00:57:30.240
Go to the middle.

753
00:57:30.406 --> 00:57:31.533
No, Steve...

754
00:57:32.534 --> 00:57:34.244
Steve, you're gonna fall.

755
00:57:40.125 --> 00:57:42.502
I really thought I was gonna fall.

756
00:57:57.809 --> 00:57:59.102
What's up?

757
00:58:20.331 --> 00:58:22.208
This is break dance.

758
00:58:22.458 --> 00:58:23.918
- Dancing?
- Yeah.

759
00:58:29.299 --> 00:58:30.383
- Whoa!
- Oh, don't worry.

760
00:58:30.592 --> 00:58:31.902
- It's fine. It's just a move.
- Yeah? Oh.

761
00:58:31.926 --> 00:58:32.927
It's nothing.

762
00:58:38.224 --> 00:58:40.393
It's all art.

763
00:58:43.271 --> 00:58:44.272
Yeah.

764
00:58:49.235 --> 00:58:50.862
Uh... That's just a trash can.

765
00:58:51.029 --> 00:58:52.780
It's just a trash can.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

766
00:58:56.576 --> 00:58:58.411
Is that a plane?

767
00:58:59.495 --> 00:59:01.998
Come on. I want to show you something.

768
00:59:21.976 --> 00:59:24.312
This is incredible!

769
00:59:38.660 --> 00:59:40.995
<i>And every time we strike gold,</i>

770
00:59:41.162 --> 00:59:43.331
<i>you strike gold.</i>

771
00:59:43.498 --> 00:59:47.752
<i>Think about finally having
everything you've always wished for.</i>

772
00:59:47.961 --> 00:59:50.213
Raquel?

773
00:59:51.756 --> 00:59:53.883
Raquel?

774
00:59:56.302 --> 00:59:59.222
Black Gold. Can you hold, please?

775
01:00:01.182 --> 01:00:03.518
Black Gold. Yes. Hold, please.

776
01:00:04.310 --> 01:00:05.478
- Raquel?
- Hold, please.

777
01:00:05.895 --> 01:00:07.021
The wells struck pay!

778
01:00:07.188 --> 01:00:08.564
- Which ones?
- All of them.

779
01:00:08.731 --> 01:00:10.358
And the investors
heard about it somehow.

780
01:00:10.525 --> 01:00:13.212
They're calling to up their buys.
Their friends are calling to buy in.

781
01:00:13.236 --> 01:00:15.196
New investors are calling
out of thin air.

782
01:00:15.363 --> 01:00:17.156
Hold on, please.
I need more help.

783
01:00:17.323 --> 01:00:19.742
- Black Gold. Can you hold, please?
- I'll get you help.

784
01:00:22.245 --> 01:00:24.372
Tell me again.
You wish you had more help?

785
01:00:24.622 --> 01:00:26.308
Yes, I wish I had more help.

786
01:00:26.332 --> 01:00:27.851
There are just too many calls to take.

787
01:00:27.875 --> 01:00:29.377
Uh... Hi.

788
01:00:29.544 --> 01:00:30.837
I'm sorry to bother you.

789
01:00:30.920 --> 01:00:32.920
I'm meant to be interviewing
at an accounting firm.

790
01:00:33.089 --> 01:00:34.369
- You're hired!
- Oh...

791
01:00:34.465 --> 01:00:35.466
Welcome aboard!

792
01:00:35.633 --> 01:00:37.176
- Emerson.
- Emerson!

793
01:00:37.343 --> 01:00:38.803
Is this the employment office?

794
01:00:38.970 --> 01:00:40.138
Yes! You're hired, too!

795
01:00:41.514 --> 01:00:43.725
Mr. Lord, it's <i>Wall Street Journal.</i>

796
01:00:43.891 --> 01:00:46.853
They want to interview you
about company's sudden surge.

797
01:00:48.229 --> 01:00:50.398
I'll take it in my office.

798
01:00:51.774 --> 01:00:54.068
And bring me my vitamins.

799
01:00:55.403 --> 01:00:57.196
So I did read
about four books last night...

800
01:00:58.197 --> 01:01:00.342
...to try to get to the bottom of this.
And did find out, Roger, you were right.

801
01:01:00.366 --> 01:01:01.951
This is from the Song Dynasty.

802
01:01:02.118 --> 01:01:03.118
You were correct.

803
01:01:03.328 --> 01:01:04.328
And also interesting,

804
01:01:04.370 --> 01:01:06.890
I was looking at a couple
of encyclopedias last night and you...

805
01:01:08.082 --> 01:01:09.375
Thanks. Um...

806
01:01:11.461 --> 01:01:15.006
So funny, all this reading seems
to have cured my eyesight somehow.

807
01:01:16.883 --> 01:01:18.634
- Interesting fact which we...
- Hey.

808
01:01:18.801 --> 01:01:19.921
- Hi.
- Good morning.

809
01:01:20.762 --> 01:01:23.056
This is Steve. He's my, um...

810
01:01:23.306 --> 01:01:24.306
- Old friend.
- Yeah.

811
01:01:24.390 --> 01:01:26.768
Hi, old friend Steve.

812
01:01:26.934 --> 01:01:28.811
I'm Barbara, Diana's new friend.

813
01:01:28.978 --> 01:01:30.313
So what do you do?

814
01:01:30.480 --> 01:01:31.481
I'm a pilot.

815
01:01:31.898 --> 01:01:33.876
- Pilot? Isn't that...
- Can I speak to you for a second?

816
01:01:33.900 --> 01:01:35.026
Sure.

817
01:01:38.112 --> 01:01:41.574
So, I just wanted to speak to you
about that stone.

818
01:01:41.741 --> 01:01:42.825
The citrine one.

819
01:01:44.285 --> 01:01:46.037
- Do you have it?
- Uh...

820
01:01:46.120 --> 01:01:49.499
Long story, actually, about that.

821
01:01:49.665 --> 01:01:52.877
Max Lord came by to visit yesterday.

822
01:01:53.044 --> 01:01:55.254
Which was actually pretty great.

823
01:01:55.421 --> 01:01:57.173
I'll tell you about it later. Um...

824
01:01:57.465 --> 01:01:59.801
I let him

825
01:02:00.426 --> 01:02:01.426
borrow it.

826
01:02:01.511 --> 01:02:02.637
What? Why?

827
01:02:02.804 --> 01:02:03.888
Well, Diana,

828
01:02:04.055 --> 01:02:05.324
he just gave us a huge amount of money.

829
01:02:05.348 --> 01:02:07.308
It's not like he's a stranger
or anything.

830
01:02:07.475 --> 01:02:09.203
Plus he has a friend who's an expert,
and I don't know...

831
01:02:09.227 --> 01:02:11.062
What do you mean? How could you loan it?

832
01:02:11.145 --> 01:02:12.897
- It's not even ours to loan.
- Whoa. Whoa.

833
01:02:13.064 --> 01:02:15.191
What are you getting on my case for?

834
01:02:15.358 --> 01:02:18.694
I've got 15 things in my office
more valuable than that stone.

835
01:02:18.861 --> 01:02:20.488
Do you know where he took it?

836
01:02:20.655 --> 01:02:22.198
No, I have no idea.

837
01:02:23.241 --> 01:02:24.826
Then I'll tell you what we find out.

838
01:02:24.992 --> 01:02:26.285
Let's go.

839
01:02:26.452 --> 01:02:28.371
- I like your pants very much.
- Oh, thanks.

840
01:02:28.538 --> 01:02:29.538
Yeah. Call me.

841
01:02:29.997 --> 01:02:32.208
Or not. Whatever.

842
01:02:32.375 --> 01:02:34.502
But I'd be curious.

843
01:02:40.716 --> 01:02:43.428
<i>Call the Black Gold hotline.</i>

844
01:02:43.511 --> 01:02:45.972
<i>Shares are not available
in the building.</i>

845
01:02:49.684 --> 01:02:50.786
What are these people doing?

846
01:02:50.810 --> 01:02:52.019
Whatever it is,

847
01:02:52.186 --> 01:02:53.938
we're not getting in that way.

848
01:02:55.940 --> 01:02:58.985
Diana. Diana, this way.

849
01:03:08.453 --> 01:03:09.454
Have at it.

850
01:03:24.135 --> 01:03:25.303
Strong lock.

851
01:03:40.318 --> 01:03:41.444
Steve.

852
01:03:57.919 --> 01:04:00.546
- It's so dusty.
- Yeah.

853
01:04:01.881 --> 01:04:03.799
It's like a bomb went off.

854
01:04:15.895 --> 01:04:18.535
Whatever this is, he's been
looking for it for a long time.

855
01:04:30.868 --> 01:04:34.497
"Place upon the object held."

856
01:04:37.500 --> 01:04:38.751
What is it?

857
01:04:39.627 --> 01:04:42.088
The language of the Gods.

858
01:04:42.255 --> 01:04:44.840
Which God wrote it, is the question.

859
01:04:47.885 --> 01:04:49.095
Thanks.

860
01:04:49.262 --> 01:04:50.846
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah. It's okay.

861
01:04:51.013 --> 01:04:53.242
I gotta go do something. Okay.
I'll talk to you. All right?

862
01:04:53.266 --> 01:04:55.351
- Hello?
<i>- Barbara, I need your help.</i>

863
01:04:55.518 --> 01:04:57.603
<i>I need you to find out</i>

864
01:04:57.770 --> 01:05:00.356
exactly where that stone was found.

865
01:05:00.523 --> 01:05:02.608
"Where" is what I need to know.
You understand?

866
01:05:02.775 --> 01:05:04.777
<i>Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, I'm on it.</i>

867
01:05:04.944 --> 01:05:06.529
Thanks.

868
01:05:09.031 --> 01:05:10.866
You look like you saw a ghost.

869
01:05:12.535 --> 01:05:14.161
I did.

870
01:05:17.039 --> 01:05:19.667
There were many Gods

871
01:05:19.834 --> 01:05:22.336
and they did different things
for different reasons.

872
01:05:22.503 --> 01:05:25.506
One was making objects like this.

873
01:05:26.716 --> 01:05:28.926
There are universal elements
in this world,

874
01:05:29.093 --> 01:05:31.971
and when they're imbued into something,

875
01:05:32.138 --> 01:05:36.309
they can become very, very powerful.

876
01:05:37.435 --> 01:05:39.312
Like my Lasso of Truth.

877
01:05:39.478 --> 01:05:41.689
The truth is what powers it, not me.

878
01:05:41.856 --> 01:05:44.734
The truth is bigger than all of us.

879
01:05:44.900 --> 01:05:46.652
But what is this?

880
01:05:48.446 --> 01:05:49.905
I don't know. Uh...

881
01:05:51.782 --> 01:05:53.576
Brought me back.

882
01:05:55.244 --> 01:05:59.040
Love or hope...

883
01:05:59.832 --> 01:06:01.542
maybe?

884
01:06:01.709 --> 01:06:03.544
Maybe.

885
01:06:05.504 --> 01:06:09.967
Well, whatever it is, I can promise you
this is too powerful for Maxwell Lord.

886
01:06:10.176 --> 01:06:11.510
We need to find this guy.

887
01:06:11.969 --> 01:06:13.804
Uh...

888
01:06:21.437 --> 01:06:23.314
Look at this.

889
01:06:23.481 --> 01:06:25.608
If this date's right,
he's going to Cairo.

890
01:06:26.609 --> 01:06:27.610
Cairo?

891
01:06:28.986 --> 01:06:32.031
Yeah.
Growth opportunity, you know?

892
01:06:32.114 --> 01:06:33.949
"King of Crude"?

893
01:06:34.700 --> 01:06:36.535
How is this so fast?

894
01:06:38.371 --> 01:06:40.122
You have a plane that can fly

895
01:06:40.289 --> 01:06:41.624
from here to Cairo in one shot?

896
01:06:41.791 --> 01:06:42.791
That is amazing.

897
01:06:42.875 --> 01:06:46.212
Yeah, but we can't get you on one
because you don't have a passport.

898
01:06:46.379 --> 01:06:47.838
I don't want to get on one,

899
01:06:48.005 --> 01:06:49.685
I want to fly one.
I want to fly the plane.

900
01:06:49.799 --> 01:06:51.133
I want to fly this plane.

901
01:06:52.301 --> 01:06:53.386
Yeah?

902
01:07:18.953 --> 01:07:21.163
Oh, my Betsy.

903
01:07:26.502 --> 01:07:28.129
Hey, Steve, this way.

904
01:07:28.295 --> 01:07:29.922
Yeah.

905
01:07:30.214 --> 01:07:32.967
Look at these gams.

906
01:07:42.810 --> 01:07:44.228
You wanna choose?

907
01:07:47.148 --> 01:07:48.315
This one.

908
01:07:49.150 --> 01:07:50.484
I like it.

909
01:08:01.579 --> 01:08:02.955
Okay.

910
01:08:05.916 --> 01:08:08.753
Okay. Uh...

911
01:08:10.296 --> 01:08:11.296
No.

912
01:08:11.714 --> 01:08:12.923
Uh...

913
01:08:14.675 --> 01:08:15.968
All right. Good, good.

914
01:08:16.135 --> 01:08:18.137
Fuel, fuel, fuel.

915
01:08:18.304 --> 01:08:19.305
Here we go. Engine.

916
01:08:21.932 --> 01:08:23.100
Here goes nothing.

917
01:08:26.437 --> 01:08:27.730
Oh...

918
01:08:39.825 --> 01:08:40.826
- Ken?
- What?

919
01:08:40.993 --> 01:08:42.453
There's an aircraft on the runway.

920
01:08:42.620 --> 01:08:44.306
What do you mean,
"There's an aircraft on the runway"?

921
01:08:44.330 --> 01:08:45.330
Approach, this is Tower.

922
01:08:45.414 --> 01:08:47.058
There's an unlisted aircraft
on the runway.

923
01:08:47.082 --> 01:08:48.209
Are you seeing this?

924
01:08:52.630 --> 01:08:54.316
- Can you get us up there?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

925
01:08:54.340 --> 01:08:55.740
I just have to pick up speed first,

926
01:08:55.841 --> 01:08:57.426
and then I'll take off.

927
01:08:57.593 --> 01:09:00.387
The way I fly, they will never find us.

928
01:09:04.892 --> 01:09:06.894
- Oh, I forgot to tell you.
- What?

929
01:09:07.061 --> 01:09:08.270
Radar. I can't explain now,

930
01:09:08.437 --> 01:09:10.564
but they'll see us anywhere,
even in the dark.

931
01:09:10.773 --> 01:09:13.359
Well, will they shoot at us?

932
01:09:14.777 --> 01:09:16.695
- Well, shit, Diana.
- Right.

933
01:09:23.452 --> 01:09:25.496
- Diana.
- Wait. Shh! I know.

934
01:09:25.663 --> 01:09:28.582
I know. Focus.

935
01:09:28.749 --> 01:09:30.668
Focus.

936
01:09:30.835 --> 01:09:32.962
My father hid Themyscira from the world,

937
01:09:33.045 --> 01:09:35.005
and I've been trying to learn
how he did it.

938
01:09:35.172 --> 01:09:36.257
Did what?

939
01:09:36.423 --> 01:09:38.300
Made something invisible.

940
01:09:38.467 --> 01:09:40.553
But in 50 years, I've only done it once.

941
01:09:40.719 --> 01:09:42.322
Well, now's not a bad time
to start trying.

942
01:09:42.346 --> 01:09:44.306
- How long does it last?
- I don't know.

943
01:09:44.473 --> 01:09:46.892
It was just a coffee cup...

944
01:09:47.059 --> 01:09:48.561
and I lost it.

945
01:10:14.378 --> 01:10:15.378
Approach,

946
01:10:15.379 --> 01:10:16.422
the aircraft has vanished.

947
01:10:16.589 --> 01:10:17.590
Do you have eyes on it?

948
01:10:45.993 --> 01:10:48.162
An invisible jet.

949
01:11:11.477 --> 01:11:12.811
What's that?

950
01:11:15.272 --> 01:11:16.272
Oh, it's okay.

951
01:11:16.315 --> 01:11:17.816
It's just fireworks.

952
01:11:18.359 --> 01:11:20.861
The Fourth. Of course.

953
01:11:21.070 --> 01:11:22.446
The Fourth of July?

954
01:12:02.987 --> 01:12:04.071
Wow.

955
01:12:15.791 --> 01:12:17.251
I got an idea.

956
01:12:53.287 --> 01:12:54.955
You know, it's the one thing.

957
01:12:55.748 --> 01:12:57.750
The one thing
that's always been you to me.

958
01:12:57.916 --> 01:12:58.916
What?

959
01:12:58.917 --> 01:12:59.918
Flight.

960
01:13:00.085 --> 01:13:01.587
Your gift.

961
01:13:01.837 --> 01:13:04.214
I'll never understand it.

962
01:13:05.090 --> 01:13:06.508
Ah, it's...

963
01:13:08.093 --> 01:13:10.220
It's so easy, really.

964
01:13:10.387 --> 01:13:12.639
It's wind and air

965
01:13:13.682 --> 01:13:17.478
and knowing how to ride it,
how to catch it.

966
01:13:19.063 --> 01:13:20.522
How to join with it.

967
01:13:22.399 --> 01:13:23.650
Yeah.

968
01:13:23.817 --> 01:13:26.195
It's like anything, really.

969
01:13:50.928 --> 01:13:52.304
Great, thanks.

970
01:13:52.930 --> 01:13:55.099
Found the last one.

971
01:13:56.266 --> 01:13:58.018
This should keep you busy for a while.

972
01:13:59.812 --> 01:14:03.190
Anything else I can get you? Coffee?

973
01:14:03.690 --> 01:14:05.192
Tea?

974
01:14:05.359 --> 01:14:07.236
Me?

975
01:14:08.946 --> 01:14:11.532
I don't need anything from you,
and I'm done.

976
01:14:11.698 --> 01:14:13.283
You're done?

977
01:14:13.700 --> 01:14:16.370
Hey, you don't have to be mean about it.

978
01:14:23.460 --> 01:14:25.462
Hey, babe. Where you going?

979
01:14:25.546 --> 01:14:27.131
No thanks.

980
01:14:30.926 --> 01:14:33.137
Ooh, you're pretty.

981
01:14:33.345 --> 01:14:35.264
Hey, slow down, sexy.

982
01:14:40.561 --> 01:14:41.812
You talking to me?

983
01:14:41.979 --> 01:14:43.856
Yep. I'm talking to you.

984
01:14:45.315 --> 01:14:48.402
Why don't you just slow down a bit, huh?

985
01:14:48.569 --> 01:14:50.529
Come on, girl.

986
01:14:50.696 --> 01:14:53.198
I'd rather not. You know what I mean?

987
01:14:55.909 --> 01:14:58.149
I'd rather not have anything to do
with someone like you.

988
01:14:58.245 --> 01:15:00.622
I'd rather you stop harassing people.

989
01:15:02.166 --> 01:15:03.834
Like me.

990
01:15:04.626 --> 01:15:05.752
Do you remember me?

991
01:15:07.754 --> 01:15:09.798
Oh, yeah, yeah.

992
01:15:10.549 --> 01:15:13.594
I remember. Where were we, huh?

993
01:15:16.597 --> 01:15:17.681
No.

994
01:15:21.852 --> 01:15:22.936
No.

995
01:15:29.610 --> 01:15:30.610
No.

996
01:15:32.946 --> 01:15:33.947
She's right.

997
01:15:34.114 --> 01:15:36.325
It's not that hard.

998
01:15:41.705 --> 01:15:44.541
Yeah, I think I get it now.

999
01:15:46.084 --> 01:15:47.836
His body weight does do all the work.

1000
01:15:52.090 --> 01:15:53.592
So easy.

1001
01:15:55.636 --> 01:15:56.929
I think

1002
01:15:57.095 --> 01:15:58.597
I could do this...

1003
01:16:01.183 --> 01:16:03.185
all...

1004
01:16:04.770 --> 01:16:05.896
night...

1005
01:16:07.481 --> 01:16:09.358
long!

1006
01:16:26.959 --> 01:16:28.418
Barbara?

1007
01:16:32.005 --> 01:16:33.715
What are you doing?

1008
01:16:36.218 --> 01:16:38.470
Mind your business.

1009
01:16:46.311 --> 01:16:47.604
Sir?

1010
01:16:55.654 --> 01:16:59.491
Your fortune the last few days
has been impressive, to say the least.

1011
01:17:00.492 --> 01:17:03.787
But why come all this way
to meet with me? Hmm?

1012
01:17:05.038 --> 01:17:06.540
To meet a peer.

1013
01:17:06.748 --> 01:17:08.250
A peer?

1014
01:17:08.417 --> 01:17:12.170
No, Mr. Lord. I only agreed
to meet with you because I was curious.

1015
01:17:12.379 --> 01:17:15.299
No one gets that lucky.
How did you do it?

1016
01:17:18.176 --> 01:17:21.888
On my journey to self-fulfillment...

1017
01:17:22.055 --> 01:17:24.349
I lucked into a secret.

1018
01:17:24.516 --> 01:17:26.435
The secret of the wish.

1019
01:17:27.394 --> 01:17:28.603
So I wished for it.

1020
01:17:28.812 --> 01:17:32.024
Or someone wished for it for me.

1021
01:17:34.067 --> 01:17:36.028
Tell me what you wish for,
Your Highness,

1022
01:17:36.278 --> 01:17:38.572
and I will show you how it works.

1023
01:17:40.198 --> 01:17:42.701
I wish for things one cannot attain.

1024
01:17:42.868 --> 01:17:44.286
Like what?

1025
01:17:46.455 --> 01:17:48.707
All of my land to be returned.

1026
01:17:48.915 --> 01:17:50.584
My ancestral realm.

1027
01:17:50.751 --> 01:17:52.711
The Bialyian Dynasty.

1028
01:17:53.211 --> 01:17:56.048
And for all the heathens
who dare trod upon it

1029
01:17:56.256 --> 01:18:01.136
to be kept out forever,
so that its glory may be renewed.

1030
01:18:01.345 --> 01:18:03.221
You wish for that?

1031
01:18:03.388 --> 01:18:06.183
I wish for that deeply.

1032
01:18:11.521 --> 01:18:13.357
Your wish is granted.

1033
01:18:13.982 --> 01:18:17.069
And in return, I will take your oil.

1034
01:18:23.241 --> 01:18:25.285
You truly delight me.

1035
01:18:25.494 --> 01:18:27.662
You know so little.

1036
01:18:27.871 --> 01:18:31.041
I sold my oil to the Saudis.

1037
01:18:31.208 --> 01:18:32.501
You are a silly man.

1038
01:18:41.218 --> 01:18:43.261
Then I will take your security team

1039
01:18:43.428 --> 01:18:45.323
and leave you here
with nothing to defend yourself

1040
01:18:45.347 --> 01:18:48.308
against the wrath you most
certainly will face.

1041
01:19:29.141 --> 01:19:31.560
Stop! Stop the car!

1042
01:19:32.185 --> 01:19:33.478
What are you doing?

1043
01:19:33.562 --> 01:19:35.397
Stop what you're doing now!
I'm telling you.

1044
01:19:35.939 --> 01:19:37.649
I command you to stop!

1045
01:19:38.733 --> 01:19:39.733
Stop!

1046
01:19:39.901 --> 01:19:42.028
Stop! Stop!

1047
01:19:44.448 --> 01:19:47.075
<i>This unbelievable and unexplainable wall</i>

1048
01:19:47.159 --> 01:19:48.660

1049

1050

<i>The government is reporting

1051
01:19:53.707 --> 01:19:55.709
<i>acknowledging his claim to the land.</i>

1052
01:20:06.720 --> 01:20:08.180
You okay?

1053
01:20:08.346 --> 01:20:10.348
I'm fine.

1054
01:20:11.057 --> 01:20:14.561
You keep saying that, but...

1055
01:20:16.855 --> 01:20:17.856
That was him!

1056
01:20:18.064 --> 01:20:19.983
That was Max Lord.

1057
01:20:48.261 --> 01:20:50.138
Get rid of them, please.

1058
01:21:26.049 --> 01:21:27.049
I got this.

1059
01:21:27.133 --> 01:21:28.133
What?

1060
01:21:29.344 --> 01:21:30.512
Diana!

1061
01:21:44.609 --> 01:21:46.236
The brakes still work.

1062
01:24:01.079 --> 01:24:02.205
Max Lord,

1063
01:24:02.414 --> 01:24:06.000
you're putting yourself
and everyone else in grave danger.

1064
01:24:06.209 --> 01:24:07.836
I need you to give me the stone.

1065
01:24:08.044 --> 01:24:10.046
What happened to it?

1066
01:24:10.213 --> 01:24:12.006
You're looking at it.

1067
01:24:18.304 --> 01:24:19.389
Whoa!

1068
01:25:10.440 --> 01:25:11.900
Steve!

1069
01:25:12.567 --> 01:25:13.567
Diana!

1070
01:26:13.545 --> 01:26:16.172
So who's the next closest person
with oil?

1071
01:26:35.900 --> 01:26:38.486
Diana. Diana.

1072
01:26:39.320 --> 01:26:42.156
My God. What's going on with you?

1073
01:26:44.617 --> 01:26:46.095
<i>A truly bizarre phenomenon</i>

1074
01:26:46.119 --> 01:26:48.472
<i>- that is being called the Divine Wall.</i>
- What is happening?

1075
01:26:48.496 --> 01:26:49.849
<i>It's an unexplainable event</i>

<i>entirely cut off from their only supply
of fresh water.</i>

1078
01:26:54.794 --> 01:26:57.589
<i>An already
tense situation now escalating</i>

1079
01:26:57.755 --> 01:27:01.676
<i>as the Soviet Union announces
they will recognize the Emir's claim.</i>

1080
01:27:01.843 --> 01:27:03.386
- Oh, no.
<i>- The United States,</i>

1081
01:27:03.553 --> 01:27:05.847
<i>a longtime ally of Egypt, has declared</i>

1082

<i>their intention to side

1083
01:27:08.725 --> 01:27:10.977
<i>Bedlam on the home front now as well</i>

1084

<i>of over half

<i>The instability in the oil community

1088

<i>in a nationwide run on gas,</i>

1089
01:27:24.240 --> 01:27:25.968
<i>and experts are girding themselves...</i>

1090
01:27:25.992 --> 01:27:26.992
Hello?

1091
01:27:27.160 --> 01:27:28.411
Barbara, it's Diana.

1092
01:27:28.578 --> 01:27:31.956
- Did you...
<i>- Yeah. Uh, well, sort of.</i>

1093
01:27:32.123 --> 01:27:34.500
<i>I haven't figured out
exactly what the stone is,</i>

1094
01:27:34.667 --> 01:27:37.420
<i>but I've found historical images of it.</i>

1095
01:27:37.503 --> 01:27:38.503
From where?

1096
01:27:38.546 --> 01:27:39.881
That's the weird thing.

1097
01:27:40.048 --> 01:27:41.591
From everywhere.

1098
01:27:41.758 --> 01:27:45.219
It first appeared in the Indus Valley
almost 4,000 years ago.

1099
01:27:45.470 --> 01:27:47.889
It popped up again
in Carthage in 146 BC.

1100
01:27:48.139 --> 01:27:49.891
Kush, 4 AD.

1101
01:27:50.141 --> 01:27:52.060
Romulus, the last Emperor of Rome,

1102
01:27:52.226 --> 01:27:54.938
he had it on him
when he was assassinated in 476.

1103
01:27:55.438 --> 01:27:59.108
<i>The last record is
in some previously unknown dead city</i>

1104
01:27:59.275 --> 01:28:00.610
<i>near Dzibilchaltun.</i>

1105
01:28:00.777 --> 01:28:02.487
- The Mayans.
<i>- Yeah.</i>

1106
01:28:02.737 --> 01:28:04.739
Anyway, it just led me
to a bunch of dead ends,

1107
01:28:04.906 --> 01:28:08.368
and my last lead is not that promising.

1108
01:28:08.534 --> 01:28:09.661
What's that?

1109
01:28:09.827 --> 01:28:11.412
<i>A flier I found.</i>

1110
01:28:11.579 --> 01:28:12.872
Grabbed it at the embassy.

1111
01:28:13.539 --> 01:28:16.459
Some guy advertising
to be a Mayan shaman.

1112
01:28:16.626 --> 01:28:19.921
But he literally teaches a course
in a squat next to Galaxy Records.

1113
01:28:20.088 --> 01:28:22.632
- And he knows about the stone?
<i>- So he says.</i>

1114
01:28:22.882 --> 01:28:24.968
I'm gonna go there in the morning.

1115
01:28:25.134 --> 01:28:28.554
Okay, we'll meet you there.
And thank you.

1116
01:28:31.474 --> 01:28:33.184
What is it?

1117
01:28:35.269 --> 01:28:36.604
The stone has traveled the world

1118
01:28:36.688 --> 01:28:38.439
to seemingly random
and different places,

1119
01:28:38.606 --> 01:28:40.942
- but they all have one thing in common.
- What?

1120
01:28:41.109 --> 01:28:43.945
Their civilizations collapsed
catastrophically.

1121
01:28:44.112 --> 01:28:45.822
Without a trace as to why.

1122
01:28:46.572 --> 01:28:48.132
You don't think the stone could have...

1123
01:28:48.866 --> 01:28:50.326
Do you?

1124
01:28:50.493 --> 01:28:52.453
I don't know what to think, Steve.

1125
01:28:53.538 --> 01:28:56.290
I can only hope I'm wrong.

1126
01:29:24.110 --> 01:29:26.237
Babajide?

1127
01:29:31.576 --> 01:29:33.494
- That was fast.
- Morning.

1128
01:29:35.705 --> 01:29:37.081
Hello.

1129
01:29:38.708 --> 01:29:40.376
One second.

1130
01:29:42.962 --> 01:29:44.562
So you're a Mayan?

1131
01:29:45.673 --> 01:29:47.425
What? I'm a citizen of the world.

1132
01:29:47.508 --> 01:29:48.718
It says your name is Frank.

1133
01:29:48.885 --> 01:29:52.096
Yeah. Most of what I know
is a past-life thing.

1134
01:29:52.263 --> 01:29:53.306
So that's a no.

1135
01:29:53.473 --> 01:29:55.391
But to answer
your question, yes.

1136
01:29:56.017 --> 01:29:58.853
My great-great-grandfather

1137
01:29:59.270 --> 01:30:00.563
left me this.

1138
01:30:00.730 --> 01:30:03.983
I don't know everything about it,
but I have been warned

1139
01:30:04.150 --> 01:30:05.651
I'm better off that way.

1140
01:30:05.818 --> 01:30:09.197
What I do know is,
it destroyed our people

1141
01:30:09.363 --> 01:30:10.740
in a matter of months.

1142
01:30:10.907 --> 01:30:12.992
The few survivors,
they buried the stone,

1143
01:30:13.534 --> 01:30:16.496
never to be exhumed
under any circumstances.

1144
01:30:16.746 --> 01:30:19.207
- Can I see that?
- Be my guest.

1145
01:30:33.679 --> 01:30:34.972
What?

1146
01:30:35.807 --> 01:30:36.807
What is it?

1147
01:30:40.812 --> 01:30:42.480
<i>Dechalafrea Ero.</i>

1148
01:30:42.647 --> 01:30:43.648
What's that?

1149
01:30:43.815 --> 01:30:46.067
A very bad God.

1150
01:30:46.234 --> 01:30:48.444
The God of Lies, Dolos, Mendacius,

1151
01:30:48.945 --> 01:30:51.114
Duke of Deception.
He's been called by many names.

1152
01:30:51.280 --> 01:30:53.491
But if he's the one
who empowered that stone,

1153
01:30:53.574 --> 01:30:54.951
there has to be a trick.

1154
01:30:55.118 --> 01:30:56.994
What do lies have to do
with granting wishes?

1155
01:30:57.161 --> 01:30:59.288
It seems more like a Dreamstone to me.

1156
01:31:00.456 --> 01:31:03.042
Wishes with a trick.

1157
01:31:03.209 --> 01:31:05.545
"The Monkey's Paw."

1158
01:31:05.711 --> 01:31:06.921
Beware what you wish for.

1159
01:31:07.088 --> 01:31:10.675
It grants your wish,
but takes your most valued possession.

1160
01:31:12.135 --> 01:31:14.053
Diana, your powers.

1161
01:31:14.220 --> 01:31:15.739
No, that doesn't
make any sense.

1162
01:31:15.763 --> 01:31:17.515
What's more precious
than what you wish for?

1163
01:31:17.682 --> 01:31:18.808
How do we stop this?

1164
01:31:18.975 --> 01:31:20.184
The legend said

1165
01:31:20.351 --> 01:31:22.037
it can only be stopped
by destroying the stone itself

1166
01:31:22.061 --> 01:31:24.623
or give back what was given.
My people couldn't do the first thing

1167
01:31:24.647 --> 01:31:26.023
and refused to do the second.

1168
01:31:27.150 --> 01:31:28.985
Now the culture's destroyed.

1169
01:31:29.152 --> 01:31:30.778
Wiped from the face of the Earth.

1170
01:31:30.945 --> 01:31:33.906
- No one renounced their wish?
- But the stone is already destroyed.

1171
01:31:34.031 --> 01:31:35.700
What? When?

1172
01:31:38.119 --> 01:31:40.163
"You're looking at it."

1173
01:31:40.663 --> 01:31:43.708
"You're looking at it."
That's what Max Lord said to me.

1174
01:31:44.292 --> 01:31:45.960
Maybe it's him.

1175
01:31:46.127 --> 01:31:48.004
He's become it somehow.

1176
01:31:48.171 --> 01:31:49.922
But how would that happen?

1177
01:31:50.089 --> 01:31:52.300
I mean, if he wished for...

1178
01:32:00.975 --> 01:32:03.811
No, that's crazy. No.

1179
01:32:03.978 --> 01:32:06.063
If we destroy it,

1180
01:32:06.189 --> 01:32:08.107
if we destroy him...

1181
01:32:09.275 --> 01:32:10.359
all the wishes go back.

1182
01:32:10.526 --> 01:32:12.195
What are you
talking about? No.

1183
01:32:12.361 --> 01:32:14.155
I'm not gonna be a part of that. No.

1184
01:32:14.238 --> 01:32:16.115
Or if everyone renounces their wish.

1185
01:32:16.199 --> 01:32:19.327
No, there has to be
a better way.

1186
01:32:19.493 --> 01:32:20.828
No.

1187
01:32:24.540 --> 01:32:25.833
She's right.

1188
01:32:26.083 --> 01:32:28.252
We don't know enough.
We just don't know enough.

1189
01:32:28.419 --> 01:32:31.339
But what we do know is that we need
to stop him before he grants any more.

1190
01:32:31.380 --> 01:32:34.926
Stopping him might not be enough, Diana.

1191
01:32:35.092 --> 01:32:36.510
Wishes have been made.

1192
01:32:38.804 --> 01:32:40.097
Barbara?

1193
01:32:41.641 --> 01:32:42.975
Barbara?

1194
01:32:51.442 --> 01:32:53.842
Like I want any of these
people in the club anyway.

1195
01:32:53.986 --> 01:32:55.422
Can we tell them they're not invited?

1196
01:32:55.446 --> 01:32:56.446
No, sir.

1197
01:32:56.530 --> 01:32:58.532
- The FCC said we couldn't...
- Oh, the FCC.

1198
01:32:58.699 --> 01:33:02.495
The BBB, the FBD.

1199
01:33:02.662 --> 01:33:05.414
It's a conspiracy against my success.

1200
01:33:05.581 --> 01:33:07.583
They're jealous. That's why.
Who's next?

1201
01:33:07.750 --> 01:33:10.211
- Who's next?
- Well, everyone you asked for,

1202
01:33:10.378 --> 01:33:12.129
Lai Zhong, Mr. Khalaji,

1203
01:33:12.296 --> 01:33:15.299
- that televangelist who stole your slot.
- Mmm.

1204
01:33:15.383 --> 01:33:16.884
And you have Alistair for the night.

1205
01:33:17.134 --> 01:33:20.096
Alistair? Again?
How many weekends do I have?

1206
01:33:20.263 --> 01:33:21.263
What? What? When?

1207
01:33:21.347 --> 01:33:22.682
Tonight?

1208
01:33:27.645 --> 01:33:28.854
He's here already.

1209
01:33:28.938 --> 01:33:30.481
His mom is with her boyfriend.

1210
01:33:36.195 --> 01:33:38.406
Send in Mr. Zhong, please.

1211
01:33:38.489 --> 01:33:41.409
And buy Alistair a pony.

1212
01:33:41.575 --> 01:33:43.786
No! A race car.
Get him a race car.

1213
01:33:46.372 --> 01:33:47.957
Let's get to it, Lai.

1214
01:33:48.499 --> 01:33:50.042
Tell me...

1215
01:33:50.918 --> 01:33:52.295
what do you want?

1216
01:33:53.587 --> 01:33:56.215
What do you wish for?

1217
01:33:56.674 --> 01:33:58.634
- Me? Truly?
- Mmm-hmm.

1218
01:33:58.759 --> 01:33:59.927
Mmm-hmm.

1219
01:34:00.928 --> 01:34:03.389
The Soviets have sided with Iran.

1220
01:34:03.889 --> 01:34:06.934
Iraq is preparing to defend ourselves,
as unrest spreads.

1221
01:34:07.101 --> 01:34:09.353
And you need? What do you...

1222
01:34:10.187 --> 01:34:12.023
What do you wish for?

1223
01:34:12.189 --> 01:34:14.400
Consider the sex tape gone.

1224
01:34:14.567 --> 01:34:16.527
And God darn it,
if I have to keep doing this

1225
01:34:16.610 --> 01:34:19.488
one by one, by one, by one...

1226
01:34:19.655 --> 01:34:21.115
- How's your health?
- Well...

1227
01:34:21.198 --> 01:34:22.198
Forget that.

1228
01:34:22.325 --> 01:34:25.995
But I will take your entire congregation
and your time slot.

1229
01:34:26.078 --> 01:34:27.078
Let me ask you,

1230
01:34:27.204 --> 01:34:29.165
when they pray, is there any way

1231
01:34:29.415 --> 01:34:32.043
I could get all of them to...

1232
01:34:32.668 --> 01:34:33.878
join hands with me?

1233
01:34:34.045 --> 01:34:35.671
And simply say, "I wish"

1234
01:34:35.838 --> 01:34:37.757
rather than, "I pray"?

1235
01:34:37.923 --> 01:34:38.966
Would that even work?

1236
01:34:39.342 --> 01:34:40.342
I don't...

1237
01:34:40.343 --> 01:34:41.635
I need to find a way

1238
01:34:41.886 --> 01:34:44.638
to touch a lot of people
at the same time.

1239
01:34:45.890 --> 01:34:47.725
Sir. The police are here.

1240
01:34:47.892 --> 01:34:50.078
They're challenging the jurisdiction
of your security team.

1241
01:34:50.102 --> 01:34:51.771
Oh, God!

1242
01:34:52.271 --> 01:34:55.191
This isn't working.
Bring in someone new.

1243
01:34:55.358 --> 01:34:56.525
And my son.

1244
01:34:56.609 --> 01:34:58.611
You, beat it.

1245
01:35:08.079 --> 01:35:09.914
Alistair!

1246
01:35:11.999 --> 01:35:14.460
I've missed you, buddy.

1247
01:35:14.627 --> 01:35:16.212
Come. Sit down with Daddy. I'm sorry.

1248
01:35:18.214 --> 01:35:23.177
But, your dad is
on the absolute precipice of everything.

1249
01:35:23.344 --> 01:35:25.471
Remember when I told you
that I would be number one?

1250
01:35:25.638 --> 01:35:27.431
Do you remember? Your dad?

1251
01:35:27.598 --> 01:35:29.642
Well, I'm inches away. Huh?

1252
01:35:29.892 --> 01:35:31.685
I know it's hard. I know.

1253
01:35:31.852 --> 01:35:33.104
But listen,

1254
01:35:33.270 --> 01:35:35.689
I also know what you wish for,
and I wish for it, too.

1255
01:35:35.856 --> 01:35:37.900
Do you hear that? I wish for it, too.

1256
01:35:38.067 --> 01:35:39.294
I just wish I could be with you...

1257
01:35:39.318 --> 01:35:40.820
No!

1258
01:35:42.655 --> 01:35:45.199
You don't use
your one wish like that, Alistair.

1259
01:35:45.491 --> 01:35:48.202
You don't wish for
something that you already have.

1260
01:35:48.369 --> 01:35:50.871
You wish for greatness, for success.

1261
01:35:51.122 --> 01:35:52.957
That's why I'm doing all of this.

1262
01:35:53.499 --> 01:35:58.003
Don't you see that my greatness
is your greatness? Huh?

1263
01:36:01.799 --> 01:36:03.634
Then I wish for your greatness.

1264
01:36:03.717 --> 01:36:05.594
No. No!

1265
01:36:18.524 --> 01:36:19.984
Thank you.

1266
01:36:21.444 --> 01:36:22.778
I love you so much.

1267
01:36:23.654 --> 01:36:28.033
And I promise you, one day,
everything is going to make sense.

1268
01:36:28.200 --> 01:36:30.911
And one day, you'll thank me.

1269
01:36:32.455 --> 01:36:35.332
But right now, I, uh...

1270
01:36:35.499 --> 01:36:38.461
Right now, I need you to stay here
with Emerson, okay? I'll be back.

1271
01:36:38.627 --> 01:36:40.713
You stay here.

1272
01:36:51.765 --> 01:36:53.142
You. You.

1273
01:36:53.309 --> 01:36:54.309
Yes, sir?

1274
01:36:54.351 --> 01:36:57.104
Don't you wish I had an audience
with the President today?

1275
01:36:57.271 --> 01:36:58.271
Of course I do.

1276
01:36:58.272 --> 01:37:00.667
And can I tell you how happy I am
that you value my opinion, sir.

1277
01:37:00.691 --> 01:37:03.277
Wait a minute.
Have I asked for your wish before?

1278
01:37:03.444 --> 01:37:05.529
Yesterday. A Porsche.

1279
01:37:05.696 --> 01:37:07.256
What is it with you aides and Porsches?

1280
01:37:07.573 --> 01:37:08.574
You!

1281
01:37:08.908 --> 01:37:09.909
Hi.

1282
01:37:10.534 --> 01:37:12.369
This way.

1283
01:37:17.291 --> 01:37:18.292
How's traffic?

1284
01:37:18.375 --> 01:37:20.002
Huh? Terrible.

1285
01:37:20.169 --> 01:37:21.378
Don't you wish it wasn't?

1286
01:37:21.545 --> 01:37:24.840
And that everywhere you went
parted like the great Red Sea?

1287
01:37:25.007 --> 01:37:29.011
Of course I wish that.
Sadly, ain't gonna happen.

1288
01:37:37.019 --> 01:37:38.312
Hey, you! Stop!

1289
01:37:38.479 --> 01:37:40.731
Come on in. It's not safe.

1290
01:37:40.898 --> 01:37:42.858
There's a riot at the Saudi Embassy

1291
01:37:43.025 --> 01:37:45.402
and there are Porsches
racing up and down the street.

1292
01:37:45.569 --> 01:37:46.569
Come on. It's mad.

1293
01:37:46.654 --> 01:37:49.615
But my cows.

1294
01:37:49.782 --> 01:37:53.285
I told a man I wanted a farm.

1295
01:37:53.452 --> 01:37:55.704
I didn't mean here.

1296
01:38:00.292 --> 01:38:02.503
I'll be right back.

1297
01:39:00.603 --> 01:39:03.314
Diana, I know it's been hard.

1298
01:39:03.480 --> 01:39:05.566
You don't know. You don't.

1299
01:39:05.733 --> 01:39:07.610
But we...

1300
01:39:07.776 --> 01:39:09.194
It can't go on like this.

1301
01:39:09.361 --> 01:39:11.481
- I can't talk about this.
- We have to talk about it.

1302
01:39:11.572 --> 01:39:13.032
Steve, I can't talk about this!

1303
01:39:18.871 --> 01:39:21.206
I give everything I have, every day.

1304
01:39:21.373 --> 01:39:23.208
And I'm happy to.

1305
01:39:23.375 --> 01:39:25.586
But this one thing...

1306
01:39:26.962 --> 01:39:31.050
You're all that I've wanted for so long.

1307
01:39:31.717 --> 01:39:35.095
You're the only joy I've had
or even asked for.

1308
01:39:36.055 --> 01:39:37.640
I am so sorry...

1309
01:39:39.850 --> 01:39:42.436
but that's crazy.

1310
01:39:42.686 --> 01:39:45.856
There's a world out there full of

1311
01:39:46.649 --> 01:39:47.816
so many better guys, for one.

1312
01:39:47.983 --> 01:39:50.194
I mean, how about this guy?
How about him?

1313
01:39:50.361 --> 01:39:52.988
I don't want him. I want you.

1314
01:39:53.155 --> 01:39:56.283
Why, for once,
can't I just have this one thing, Steve?

1315
01:39:56.450 --> 01:39:57.993
This one thing.

1316
01:40:01.038 --> 01:40:03.290
I'm not sure we have a choice.

1317
01:40:05.542 --> 01:40:08.045
Well, I do have a choice.

1318
01:40:08.212 --> 01:40:09.672
And I can't give you up. I can't.

1319
01:40:09.838 --> 01:40:12.049
So I won't. So we need to stop him

1320
01:40:12.216 --> 01:40:14.343
so we can figure that out.

1321
01:40:14.510 --> 01:40:15.636
There has to be another way.

1322
01:40:17.221 --> 01:40:18.639
Has to.

1323
01:40:31.819 --> 01:40:32.820
Wow.

1324
01:40:33.821 --> 01:40:36.782
This is incredible.

1325
01:40:41.870 --> 01:40:42.871
What's that?

1326
01:40:44.373 --> 01:40:46.250
From my culture.

1327
01:40:46.417 --> 01:40:50.379
The armor of an ancient Amazon warrior.
One of our greatest.

1328
01:40:50.963 --> 01:40:53.424
It's huge. This whole thing?

1329
01:40:55.676 --> 01:40:56.927
What is it made out of?

1330
01:40:57.094 --> 01:40:58.804
Here. Let me show you.

1331
01:40:59.763 --> 01:41:01.014
Give me your hand.

1332
01:41:01.807 --> 01:41:03.487
What are you talking about?
I haven't lied.

1333
01:41:03.517 --> 01:41:05.936
The Lasso does more
than just make you tell the truth.

1334
01:41:06.103 --> 01:41:08.063
It can make you see it, too.

1335
01:41:14.069 --> 01:41:15.696
<i>Her name was Asteria.</i>

1336
01:41:15.863 --> 01:41:17.865
<i>She was our greatest warrior.</i>

1337
01:41:18.031 --> 01:41:22.244
<i>When mankind enslaved the Amazons,
my mother freed us.</i>

1338
01:41:22.453 --> 01:41:25.372
<i>But someone had to stay behind
to hold back the tide of men</i>

1339
01:41:25.539 --> 01:41:28.625
<i>so the others
could escape to Themyscira.</i>

1340
01:41:28.792 --> 01:41:30.627
<i>My people gave up all of their armor</i>

1341
01:41:30.794 --> 01:41:35.215
<i>to make her one suit strong enough
to take on the whole world.</i>

1342
01:41:36.258 --> 01:41:41.305
<i>And Asteria sacrificed herself
for a better day for others.</i>

1343
01:41:45.350 --> 01:41:46.643
That's...

1344
01:41:48.562 --> 01:41:49.730
That's incredible.

1345
01:41:49.897 --> 01:41:52.858
When I came here, I searched for her.

1346
01:41:53.025 --> 01:41:56.236
But all I could find was her armor.

1347
01:41:56.403 --> 01:41:57.863
What is this?

1348
01:41:59.239 --> 01:42:00.908
Where is he going?

1349
01:42:01.074 --> 01:42:02.367
Oh, no.

1350
01:42:22.304 --> 01:42:23.639
Diana, Diana! What are you doing?

1351
01:42:23.806 --> 01:42:25.742
- Where are you going?
- Steve, I'm going. You need to stay.

1352
01:42:25.766 --> 01:42:27.684
No. No. Listen to me.

1353
01:42:27.851 --> 01:42:29.102
You're getting weaker, Diana.

1354
01:42:29.269 --> 01:42:30.437
- What if you fall?
- I won't.

1355
01:42:30.604 --> 01:42:32.648
You might. We don't know that.

1356
01:42:33.607 --> 01:42:35.776
There has to be another way in.

1357
01:42:48.497 --> 01:42:50.332
Everything okay, Mr. President?

1358
01:42:50.833 --> 01:42:51.834
Yes.

1359
01:42:52.876 --> 01:42:55.254
Something very strange. I...

1360
01:42:55.420 --> 01:42:58.715
I thought I was somewhere else entirely.
Suddenly...

1361
01:43:00.217 --> 01:43:02.886
Anyway. Hectic times.

1362
01:43:04.263 --> 01:43:06.431
Give us a minute.

1363
01:43:12.354 --> 01:43:13.354
Excuse me.

1364
01:43:16.859 --> 01:43:18.443
- Carl.
- Diana.

1365
01:43:18.610 --> 01:43:20.320
- Hi.
- What a pleasure.

1366
01:43:20.487 --> 01:43:22.489
Good to see you. How have you been?

1367
01:43:22.656 --> 01:43:23.907
- Good.
- This is Steve.

1368
01:43:24.074 --> 01:43:25.534
Steve, this is Carl. My colleague.

1369
01:43:25.701 --> 01:43:27.494
- Hi.
- Hi.

1370
01:43:28.161 --> 01:43:29.371
Shall we, uh...

1371
01:43:29.538 --> 01:43:31.957
Yeah, we shall.

1372
01:43:32.124 --> 01:43:33.625
I'm sorry, Mr. Lord.

1373
01:43:33.792 --> 01:43:36.073
In fact, I don't even know
what we're supposed to discuss.

1374
01:43:36.128 --> 01:43:37.296
Exactly that, Mr. President.

1375
01:43:37.462 --> 01:43:41.174
These hectic days, hectic times.

1376
01:43:42.426 --> 01:43:43.427
And you.

1377
01:43:43.594 --> 01:43:45.154
<i>These aren't exactly my favorite</i>

1378
01:43:45.262 --> 01:43:46.722
of the busts on display here,

1379
01:43:46.889 --> 01:43:50.434
but it's a little picture of my top ten,
maybe top five at a push.

1380
01:43:50.601 --> 01:43:52.811
Oh, here's something up ahead
that will interest you.

1381
01:43:52.978 --> 01:43:57.608
These are floor tiles originally laid
by none other than Jan Lincoln,

1382
01:43:57.774 --> 01:43:59.526
a little-known descendent of Abraham.

1383
01:44:00.277 --> 01:44:02.779
You're having some troubles?

1384
01:44:02.946 --> 01:44:04.281
Everywhere suddenly.

1385
01:44:04.448 --> 01:44:06.199
Cuba, Egypt,

1386
01:44:06.366 --> 01:44:07.784
even here.

1387
01:44:08.577 --> 01:44:09.661
But Russia...

1388
01:44:10.245 --> 01:44:12.080
- very troublesome.
- Mmm.

1389
01:44:14.082 --> 01:44:15.542
I appreciate your concern,

1390
01:44:15.709 --> 01:44:17.711
but all the money in the world
won't help us now.

1391
01:44:17.878 --> 01:44:20.047
It's not money I'm offering.

1392
01:44:20.213 --> 01:44:21.673
You.

1393
01:44:22.758 --> 01:44:24.384
You are a man of faith,

1394
01:44:24.885 --> 01:44:27.554
and I have been very blessed lately.

1395
01:44:31.141 --> 01:44:33.644
I want to share my blessing with you.

1396
01:44:34.811 --> 01:44:37.272
The power of positive thinking.

1397
01:44:41.151 --> 01:44:42.152
Now...

1398
01:44:43.528 --> 01:44:46.990
tell me, Mr. President,
what do you need?

1399
01:44:47.157 --> 01:44:50.369
And you're not speaking to me here,
but to the universe.

1400
01:44:50.535 --> 01:44:52.746
What do you wish for?

1401
01:44:55.332 --> 01:44:57.918
What is there to wish for but more?

1402
01:44:58.085 --> 01:44:59.878
More nuclear weapons.
More than they have.

1403
01:45:00.128 --> 01:45:01.755
Closer to 'em.

1404
01:45:01.922 --> 01:45:03.632
If I just had that in place,

1405
01:45:03.924 --> 01:45:06.051
then they would have to listen to us.

1406
01:45:06.176 --> 01:45:09.221
A nice thought.
And I grant you...

1407
01:45:12.057 --> 01:45:13.433
Oh... Oh, my...

1408
01:45:18.438 --> 01:45:20.607
And you know what I'd like?

1409
01:45:21.984 --> 01:45:25.904
I would want all of your power,
influence, authority.

1410
01:45:26.071 --> 01:45:27.364
All the respect you command

1411
01:45:27.531 --> 01:45:31.618
and the command everyone must respect.

1412
01:45:37.499 --> 01:45:39.334
I mean, what else is there?

1413
01:45:40.627 --> 01:45:43.338
Now, tell your people I would appreciate

1414
01:45:43.505 --> 01:45:47.009
absolutely no interference whatsoever.

1415
01:45:47.300 --> 01:45:49.594
No taxes, no rule of law, no limits.

1416
01:45:49.761 --> 01:45:54.099
Treat me like a foreign nation
with absolute autonomy.

1417
01:45:55.517 --> 01:45:56.643
Very good, sir.

1418
01:45:56.935 --> 01:45:57.936
Right away.

1419
01:46:05.652 --> 01:46:06.652
What's this?

1420
01:46:06.695 --> 01:46:08.155
Global Broadcast Satellite.

1421
01:46:08.321 --> 01:46:09.781
Top-secret program that enables us

1422
01:46:09.865 --> 01:46:12.075
to override any broadcast system
in the world

1423
01:46:12.242 --> 01:46:15.704
in case we need direct contact
with the people of an enemy state.

1424
01:46:15.954 --> 01:46:16.997
So what does that mean?

1425
01:46:17.164 --> 01:46:19.249
You're taking over everyone's TVs?

1426
01:46:19.499 --> 01:46:20.499
How?

1427
01:46:20.584 --> 01:46:22.335
It uses
particle beam technology,

1428
01:46:22.419 --> 01:46:23.962
just like the Star Wars program.

1429
01:46:24.129 --> 01:46:27.632
Apparently, it bathes the landscape
in a signal of particles that goes in

1430
01:46:27.799 --> 01:46:29.634
and fiddles with
any technology it touches.

1431
01:46:30.677 --> 01:46:33.305
New or old. Broadcast whatever you want.

1432
01:46:33.472 --> 01:46:34.890
Very impressive.

1433
01:46:35.057 --> 01:46:38.477
You said "touches"?

1434
01:46:39.770 --> 01:46:42.606
As in the particles you are sending...

1435
01:46:45.358 --> 01:46:49.905
are touching everything?

1436
01:46:50.113 --> 01:46:51.393
It's a figure of speech,

1437
01:46:51.531 --> 01:46:52.699
but yes.

1438
01:46:52.866 --> 01:46:54.802
- That's how it was explained to me.
- I need immediate access

1439
01:46:54.826 --> 01:46:57.245
to this satellite. And a chopper

1440
01:46:57.412 --> 01:46:58.328
to get me there.

1441
01:46:58.330 --> 01:46:59.770
Yes, sir. Right away.

1442
01:47:10.634 --> 01:47:12.636
Well, aren't you resourceful?

1443
01:47:12.803 --> 01:47:15.931
Come with me
before you do any more damage, Max.

1444
01:47:16.014 --> 01:47:17.641
No. I don't think so.

1445
01:47:17.724 --> 01:47:18.844
Remove this woman, please...

1446
01:47:19.518 --> 01:47:21.144
permanently.

1447
01:47:30.237 --> 01:47:32.322
- Are you okay?
- I don't know.

1448
01:47:35.659 --> 01:47:36.859
No, Steve. You can't use that.

1449
01:47:36.910 --> 01:47:38.912
It's not their fault.

1450
01:48:27.085 --> 01:48:28.253
That's neat.

1451
01:49:01.703 --> 01:49:03.205
Barbara.

1452
01:49:06.458 --> 01:49:08.168
I can't let you do this, Diana.

1453
01:49:38.949 --> 01:49:41.785
Barbara. What...

1454
01:49:41.952 --> 01:49:44.246
- How...
- I can't let you stop Max.

1455
01:49:45.121 --> 01:49:47.457
You're not the only one
with something to lose.

1456
01:49:51.211 --> 01:49:53.338
Turns out wishing to be like you...

1457
01:49:54.714 --> 01:49:56.633
came with some surprises.

1458
01:50:00.262 --> 01:50:01.262
Hands up.

1459
01:50:01.263 --> 01:50:02.907
- Hands up.
- Hands up, hands up.

1460
01:50:02.931 --> 01:50:03.931
Hands up!

1461
01:50:03.932 --> 01:50:05.809
- Hands up!
- Now! Now, now!

1462
01:50:19.572 --> 01:50:20.782
Open fire!

1463
01:50:35.755 --> 01:50:38.925
Oh, how sweet, defending your love. Huh?

1464
01:50:39.092 --> 01:50:41.678
What do you wish for?
Do you wanna be a real boy?

1465
01:50:41.845 --> 01:50:42.845
No.

1466
01:50:43.471 --> 01:50:45.598
Just not to be handcuffed to you,
but now I am.

1467
01:50:53.481 --> 01:50:55.081
I just learned that.

1468
01:51:07.329 --> 01:51:08.538
Barbara, stop!

1469
01:51:11.124 --> 01:51:12.124
Ahh!

1470
01:51:19.883 --> 01:51:20.883
Listen.

1471
01:51:20.925 --> 01:51:22.028
You have no idea
what you're dealing with.

1472
01:51:22.052 --> 01:51:23.052
I'm not what you think.

1473
01:51:23.178 --> 01:51:24.739
You can't possibly
understand or handle...

1474
01:51:24.763 --> 01:51:26.931
Oh, I can't possibly understand?

1475
01:51:30.477 --> 01:51:31.478
Oh...

1476
01:51:31.770 --> 01:51:33.313
Dumb little old me.

1477
01:51:33.480 --> 01:51:34.898
Dumb little, poor little

1478
01:51:35.065 --> 01:51:36.983
nothing, nobody me.

1479
01:51:37.150 --> 01:51:38.568
I couldn't possibly handle it.

1480
01:51:38.818 --> 01:51:41.196
No, Barbara. That's not what I'm saying.

1481
01:51:47.369 --> 01:51:49.788
Well, I'm handling it beautifully.

1482
01:51:50.246 --> 01:51:51.790
And I'm not giving it back!

1483
01:52:16.147 --> 01:52:17.147
Go.

1484
01:52:18.066 --> 01:52:19.066
Run!

1485
01:52:20.276 --> 01:52:21.444
Everyone, stand down.

1486
01:52:22.237 --> 01:52:24.364
Nobody hurts her.

1487
01:52:26.116 --> 01:52:27.784
They couldn't if they tried.

1488
01:52:32.747 --> 01:52:34.666
You've always had everything,

1489
01:52:34.999 --> 01:52:37.502
while people like me have had nothing.

1490
01:52:38.169 --> 01:52:42.215
Well, now it's my turn.
And you are not taking it from me. Ever!

1491
01:52:43.967 --> 01:52:45.718
But what is it costing you?

1492
01:52:45.802 --> 01:52:47.303
What is it costing me?

1493
01:52:47.387 --> 01:52:50.557
If it's the monkey's paw,
it takes as much as it gives.

1494
01:52:52.767 --> 01:52:54.811
Yes, you're strong...

1495
01:52:55.770 --> 01:52:58.022
but what did you lose, Barbara?

1496
01:52:58.898 --> 01:53:02.277
Where's your warmth, your joy,

1497
01:53:02.444 --> 01:53:03.945
your humanity?

1498
01:53:04.112 --> 01:53:07.824
You're attacking innocent men, Barbara.
Look at yourself.

1499
01:53:07.991 --> 01:53:09.868
Forget about me.

1500
01:53:10.034 --> 01:53:12.120
What is it costing you?

1501
01:53:17.250 --> 01:53:19.711
Yeah, yeah.

1502
01:53:19.878 --> 01:53:21.629
That's right.

1503
01:53:22.505 --> 01:53:24.466
Get used to it.

1504
01:53:27.260 --> 01:53:29.554
If you go after Max Lord...

1505
01:53:30.472 --> 01:53:32.307
or hurt him in any way,

1506
01:53:32.891 --> 01:53:34.267
I will destroy you.

1507
01:53:34.434 --> 01:53:35.435
Barbara!

1508
01:53:52.869 --> 01:53:54.579
Are you all right?

1509
01:54:16.100 --> 01:54:18.102
Room for one more?

1510
01:54:26.903 --> 01:54:28.255
<i>Sir, you need to wait.</i>

1511
01:54:28.279 --> 01:54:30.424
- The President has a meeting right now.
- We need to see the President.

1512
01:54:30.448 --> 01:54:31.824
He needs to be told.

1513
01:54:32.033 --> 01:54:33.969
- This is a matter of life and death.
- What is going on?

1514
01:54:33.993 --> 01:54:36.788
The Soviets' early detection system
picked up our new nukes.

1515
01:54:37.205 --> 01:54:38.224
<i>What new nukes?</i>

1516
01:54:38.248 --> 01:54:41.626
<i>A hundred warheads
just went online, ready to launch.</i>

1517
01:54:41.793 --> 01:54:43.795
<i>They're taking this as an act of war.</i>

1518
01:54:43.920 --> 01:54:45.338
Prepping to return fire.

1519
01:54:45.505 --> 01:54:47.090
Return? What?

1520
01:54:47.257 --> 01:54:49.133
We haven't done anything.

1521
01:54:49.300 --> 01:54:50.593
That's not how it looks.

1522
01:54:50.885 --> 01:54:53.137
And we'd fire for less.

1523
01:54:56.224 --> 01:54:57.224
Are you kidding me?

1524
01:54:57.225 --> 01:54:59.811
You blew through that light right there!
You didn't even see!

1525
01:54:59.978 --> 01:55:01.205
How do you not see that?

1526
01:55:01.229 --> 01:55:03.273
Riots across the world erupting

1527
01:55:03.439 --> 01:55:06.818
as America and the Soviet Union
end communication,

1528
01:55:06.985 --> 01:55:08.945
declaring war!

1529
01:55:09.112 --> 01:55:10.655
No one knows any more than that.

1530
01:55:10.822 --> 01:55:12.699
But as you can imagine
with what's at stake,

1531
01:55:12.865 --> 01:55:15.034
there has been madness down here

1532
01:55:15.201 --> 01:55:16.578
in downtown Washington, D.C.

1533
01:55:16.744 --> 01:55:18.538
The national guard
has been brought in...

1534
01:55:18.705 --> 01:55:21.207
<i>Attention! Attention!</i>

1535
01:55:21.374 --> 01:55:23.668
<i>By executive order, all civilians</i>

1536
01:55:23.835 --> 01:55:27.005
<i>must immediately evacuate
the Pennsylvania Avenue corridor</i>

1537
01:55:27.171 --> 01:55:30.049
<i>between 3rd and 12th streets northwest.</i>

1538
01:55:37.974 --> 01:55:40.310
It is the final days
of tribulation

1539
01:55:40.393 --> 01:55:42.520
that is happening to us now.

1540
01:55:42.687 --> 01:55:45.898
Can you see
what your sinfulness has done?

1541
01:55:46.065 --> 01:55:47.317
Your greed?

1542
01:55:47.859 --> 01:55:50.278
You gotta do something!
You gotta do something!

1543
01:55:51.654 --> 01:55:54.490
Come on! This way! Come on!

1544
01:55:59.329 --> 01:56:00.330
Riley!

1545
01:56:01.122 --> 01:56:02.165
All units.

1546
01:56:02.707 --> 01:56:03.707
Riley!

1547
01:56:03.833 --> 01:56:05.126
We need help.

1548
01:56:06.336 --> 01:56:08.838
- It's chaos out here.
- Riley!

1549
01:56:09.005 --> 01:56:12.425
What do you want me to do?
I don't know what to do.

1550
01:56:12.592 --> 01:56:14.427
Somebody help me.

1551
01:56:14.927 --> 01:56:17.096
I don't know what to do.

1552
01:56:21.476 --> 01:56:22.894
Diana.

1553
01:56:23.978 --> 01:56:25.688
Diana, listen to me.

1554
01:56:30.443 --> 01:56:33.696
I had a great life.

1555
01:56:34.739 --> 01:56:35.823
Steve...

1556
01:56:35.990 --> 01:56:38.451
And you only made it better.

1557
01:56:40.244 --> 01:56:43.331
But you know what you need to do.

1558
01:56:43.498 --> 01:56:44.957
The world needs you.

1559
01:56:49.879 --> 01:56:51.881
- All right?
- No.

1560
01:56:52.048 --> 01:56:53.800
Yeah.

1561
01:57:06.646 --> 01:57:08.272
I'll never love again.

1562
01:57:08.439 --> 01:57:09.565
I pray that isn't true.

1563
01:57:10.608 --> 01:57:13.569
There's a wonderful,
big world out there.

1564
01:57:13.736 --> 01:57:16.656
This crazy new world.

1565
01:57:17.407 --> 01:57:20.368
And I am so happy I got to see it...

1566
01:57:21.369 --> 01:57:23.454
but it deserves you.

1567
01:57:33.506 --> 01:57:35.466
I can't say goodbye.

1568
01:57:35.633 --> 01:57:38.302
I can't say goodbye.

1569
01:57:39.262 --> 01:57:41.055
You don't have to.

1570
01:57:45.184 --> 01:57:47.729
I'm already gone.

1571
01:58:01.784 --> 01:58:03.703
I'll always love you, Diana,

1572
01:58:03.870 --> 01:58:06.622
no matter where I am.

1573
01:58:06.789 --> 01:58:08.583
I love you.

1574
01:58:11.294 --> 01:58:13.838
I renounce my wish.

1575
01:59:08.810 --> 01:59:10.061
<i>It's easy.</i>

1576
01:59:12.522 --> 01:59:15.274
<i>It's only wind and air...</i>

1577
01:59:16.901 --> 01:59:18.653
<i>and how to ride it.</i>

1578
01:59:20.863 --> 01:59:22.865
<i>How to catch it.</i>

1579
02:00:36.063 --> 02:00:37.231
You made a wish too, huh?

1580
02:00:41.819 --> 02:00:43.571
They're a bitch, aren't they?

1581
02:00:43.738 --> 02:00:47.158
Make you pay a price,
but I've never been one for rules.

1582
02:00:47.325 --> 02:00:49.243
Luckily, I have a way to reverse it.

1583
02:00:50.828 --> 02:00:53.080
The answer is always more.

1584
02:00:53.372 --> 02:00:54.957
But you only get one wish.

1585
02:00:55.124 --> 02:00:57.835
But I, my dear, grant the wishes.

1586
02:00:58.002 --> 02:01:01.130
So I take what I want in return.

1587
02:01:01.297 --> 02:01:04.133
There's nothing in this world
someone doesn't have.

1588
02:01:04.300 --> 02:01:07.595
I'll rebuild my health, wish by wish,
organ by organ...

1589
02:01:08.512 --> 02:01:09.764
if I have to.

1590
02:01:11.265 --> 02:01:12.892
I'll be invincible.

1591
02:01:14.393 --> 02:01:15.937
Tell me,

1592
02:01:16.103 --> 02:01:18.105
what do you want?

1593
02:01:18.272 --> 02:01:20.358
I'm feeling generous.

1594
02:01:23.819 --> 02:01:27.865
I don't want to be like anyone anymore.

1595
02:01:30.076 --> 02:01:32.328
I want to be number one.

1596
02:01:35.122 --> 02:01:37.875
An apex predator,

1597
02:01:38.042 --> 02:01:41.253
like nothing there's ever been before.

1598
02:01:42.630 --> 02:01:45.091
I like the way you think.

1599
02:01:46.467 --> 02:01:47.802
Go on.

1600
02:02:00.856 --> 02:02:03.526
You heard we were coming,
I presume?

1601
02:02:04.694 --> 02:02:07.488
How many broadcasting signals
can I take over at once?

1602
02:02:07.655 --> 02:02:09.448
Well, as many as you like, sir.

1603
02:02:09.949 --> 02:02:11.367
I'll take all of them.

1604
02:02:11.534 --> 02:02:12.743
All of them?

1605
02:02:13.536 --> 02:02:17.540
And I sure wish this works for me.
Don't you?

1606
02:02:18.207 --> 02:02:19.583
Yes, sir.

1607
02:02:22.586 --> 02:02:24.714
Lights, camera...

1608
02:02:24.880 --> 02:02:26.424
Okay, stations 12,

1609
02:02:26.590 --> 02:02:28.676
9, 16, go transmit.

1610
02:02:28.843 --> 02:02:31.637
I need it now.
16, 9, 12. Do you receive?

1611
02:02:31.721 --> 02:02:32.948
Copy. Maximum power.

1612
02:02:32.972 --> 02:02:34.324
Okay. Moving forward now.

1613
02:02:34.348 --> 02:02:35.933
Global transmission in five,

1614
02:02:36.100 --> 02:02:38.519
four, three, two...

1615
02:02:42.481 --> 02:02:44.650
<i>Citizens of the world,</i>

1616
02:02:44.900 --> 02:02:48.738
<i>allow me to introduce myself.</i>

1617
02:02:49.363 --> 02:02:51.949
<i>I am Max Lord,</i>

1618
02:02:52.158 --> 02:02:54.493
<i>and I'm here to change your life.</i>

1619
02:02:55.619 --> 02:02:58.122
<i>All you have to do...</i>

1620
02:02:59.290 --> 02:03:01.167
<i>is make a wish.</i>

1621
02:03:02.501 --> 02:03:04.920
<i>Anything you want.</i>

1622
02:03:05.421 --> 02:03:07.757
<i>Anything you dream of, you can have it.</i>

1623
02:03:09.258 --> 02:03:10.843
<i>If you can dream it...</i>

1624
02:03:11.010 --> 02:03:12.010
Daddy?

1625
02:03:12.136 --> 02:03:13.846
<i>...you can achieve it.</i>

1626
02:03:14.847 --> 02:03:17.516
<i>So just look into my eyes...</i>

1627
02:03:18.851 --> 02:03:20.936
<i>and make a wish.</i>

1628
02:03:21.353 --> 02:03:24.690
<i>Anything you dream of,</i>

1629
02:03:24.857 --> 02:03:26.097
<i>have it.</i>

1630
02:03:27.443 --> 02:03:29.403
<i>Right now.</i>

1631
02:03:30.237 --> 02:03:32.698
<i>Do you want to be rich?</i>

1632
02:03:33.157 --> 02:03:36.202
<i>Do you want to be powerful?</i>

1633
02:03:36.368 --> 02:03:37.763
Yeah, yeah. Whatever you say.

1634
02:03:37.787 --> 02:03:39.306
- <i>Say it out loud!</i>
- You know what I wish?

1635
02:03:39.330 --> 02:03:40.849
- What? What?
- I wish all you Irish bastards

1636
02:03:40.873 --> 02:03:43.334
would get sent back
to where you came from!

1637
02:03:43.501 --> 02:03:45.002
Yeah? Well, I wish you'd drop dead!

1638
02:03:45.086 --> 02:03:48.005
<i>Look around you.</i>

1639
02:03:48.172 --> 02:03:50.299
<i>Make your wish!</i>

1640
02:03:50.466 --> 02:03:52.218
<i>Take what's yours.</i>

1641
02:03:52.384 --> 02:03:54.220
<i>Whatever you want,</i>

1642
02:03:54.386 --> 02:03:55.930
<i>you can have it.</i>

1643
02:03:56.097 --> 02:03:58.497
I wish for a million dollars.

1644
02:04:03.521 --> 02:04:05.064
<i>Wish for it.</i>

1645
02:04:17.701 --> 02:04:19.662
<i>Anything you want.</i>

1646
02:04:20.079 --> 02:04:24.166
<i>Anything you dream of, have it.</i>

1647
02:04:25.042 --> 02:04:26.293
<i>Yes.</i>

1648
02:04:26.460 --> 02:04:28.003
<i>I can hear it.</i>

1649
02:04:28.087 --> 02:04:30.673
<i>I hear you.</i>

1650
02:04:30.840 --> 02:04:31.840
<i>Yes, say it.</i>

1651
02:04:31.966 --> 02:04:33.300
<i>Say it out loud.</i>

1652
02:04:33.884 --> 02:04:35.469
That's right. "I wish."

1653
02:04:37.096 --> 02:04:38.096
Take it.

1654
02:04:38.222 --> 02:04:40.474
Take it. It's all yours.

1655
02:04:40.641 --> 02:04:42.476
It's all yours for the taking!

1656
02:04:47.064 --> 02:04:49.817
And I... I take your health

1657
02:04:50.609 --> 02:04:52.736
and your strength.

1658
02:04:52.903 --> 02:04:54.029
Give her your rage

1659
02:04:54.572 --> 02:04:56.448
and your prowess.

1660
02:04:56.615 --> 02:04:59.451
And I take your power.

1661
02:04:59.618 --> 02:05:01.579
I take your life force.

1662
02:05:01.745 --> 02:05:03.372
Yes.

1663
02:05:03.664 --> 02:05:05.082
Yes!

1664
02:05:07.585 --> 02:05:09.044
That's right.

1665
02:05:09.420 --> 02:05:11.755
You're doing great.

1666
02:05:18.220 --> 02:05:19.972
<i>It's all yours.</i>

1667
02:05:20.139 --> 02:05:21.557
I wish you were here, Daddy.

1668
02:05:21.724 --> 02:05:23.684
I wish you'd come back. Daddy, please!

1669
02:05:23.851 --> 02:05:26.562
<i>- All you have to do is wish for it.</i>
- I'm still here, Daddy.

1670
02:05:26.729 --> 02:05:28.439
Daddy, please!

1671
02:06:42.137 --> 02:06:43.973
Barbara.

1672
02:06:44.848 --> 02:06:47.101
What did you do?

1673
02:08:34.750 --> 02:08:35.750
No.

1674
02:08:37.169 --> 02:08:39.129
You renounced your wish.

1675
02:08:39.380 --> 02:08:41.715
I had to. And so do you.

1676
02:08:42.508 --> 02:08:45.260
Nothing good is born from lies, Barbara.

1677
02:08:46.095 --> 02:08:48.472
We're wasting precious time.

1678
02:08:48.931 --> 02:08:53.018
Even now, patronizing me.

1679
02:10:22.941 --> 02:10:24.568
Barbara...

1680
02:10:24.735 --> 02:10:28.113
I know you're in there.
Please. Please, renounce your wish.

1681
02:10:28.363 --> 02:10:29.698
It's over.

1682
02:10:29.823 --> 02:10:31.408
Please!

1683
02:10:31.825 --> 02:10:33.160
Renounce your wish.

1684
02:10:33.660 --> 02:10:34.786
Never!

1685
02:10:38.123 --> 02:10:39.917
Then I'm so sorry.

1686
02:11:22.918 --> 02:11:23.919
That's right.

1687
02:11:24.545 --> 02:11:26.046
Just wish for it.

1688
02:11:26.213 --> 02:11:27.548
It's yours now.

1689
02:11:29.007 --> 02:11:31.385
All you have to do is say it out loud.

1690
02:11:31.552 --> 02:11:34.096
Make a wish. Any wish.

1691
02:11:34.346 --> 02:11:37.307
Look into my eyes,
and everything you've been waiting for,

1692
02:11:37.474 --> 02:11:38.809
it's all yours.

1693
02:11:39.142 --> 02:11:40.142
You're too late.

1694
02:11:41.937 --> 02:11:43.564
Granted.

1695
02:11:44.565 --> 02:11:45.941
Granted.

1696
02:11:46.817 --> 02:11:48.527
Granted.

1697
02:11:49.444 --> 02:11:50.737
Granted!

1698
02:11:51.446 --> 02:11:53.991
- Granted.
- Why are you doing this?

1699
02:11:54.157 --> 02:11:55.742
Don't you have enough?

1700
02:11:55.909 --> 02:11:57.703
Why not more?

1701
02:11:57.869 --> 02:11:59.580
Why not wish for more?

1702
02:11:59.746 --> 02:12:01.957
But they don't know
what you're taking from them.

1703
02:12:02.124 --> 02:12:04.126
We want what we want.

1704
02:12:04.293 --> 02:12:05.794
Just like you did.

1705
02:12:08.005 --> 02:12:09.423
So make a wish.

1706
02:12:09.590 --> 02:12:10.590
Very good.

1707
02:12:20.767 --> 02:12:22.728
Granted.

1708
02:12:24.855 --> 02:12:27.399
It's too late, Diana.

1709
02:12:27.566 --> 02:12:30.110
They already heard me.

1710
02:12:30.193 --> 02:12:32.446
Already wished!

1711
02:12:34.573 --> 02:12:38.410
And those that haven't yet...

1712
02:12:40.662 --> 02:12:43.457
oh, they will!

1713
02:12:56.928 --> 02:12:58.889
Granted.

1714
02:12:59.056 --> 02:13:01.016
Granted.

1715
02:13:02.142 --> 02:13:03.393
Granted.

1716
02:13:09.399 --> 02:13:11.568
Poor Diana.

1717
02:13:12.694 --> 02:13:14.863
Why be such a hero?

1718
02:13:16.281 --> 02:13:18.367
You could have kept your pilot

1719
02:13:18.992 --> 02:13:20.577
and your powers,

1720
02:13:20.744 --> 02:13:23.497
if only you'd join me.

1721
02:13:24.039 --> 02:13:27.125
Wanna reconsider?

1722
02:13:28.293 --> 02:13:31.296
I'm a forgiving man!

1723
02:13:35.425 --> 02:13:37.427
You want him back?

1724
02:13:37.594 --> 02:13:39.971
Just say the word.

1725
02:13:40.138 --> 02:13:42.641
You can have it all!

1726
02:13:42.808 --> 02:13:46.853
You just have to want it!

1727
02:13:49.106 --> 02:13:52.192
I've never wanted anything more.

1728
02:13:58.198 --> 02:14:00.450
But he's gone...

1729
02:14:01.284 --> 02:14:03.704
and that's the truth.

1730
02:14:04.454 --> 02:14:06.665
And everything has a price.

1731
02:14:06.832 --> 02:14:09.167
One I'm not willing to pay.

1732
02:14:09.334 --> 02:14:10.752
Not anymore.

1733
02:14:17.801 --> 02:14:22.681
This world was a beautiful place
just as it was...

1734
02:14:23.932 --> 02:14:26.560
and you cannot have it all.

1735
02:14:27.394 --> 02:14:30.230
You can only have the truth.

1736
02:14:31.022 --> 02:14:33.942
And the truth is enough.

1737
02:14:34.109 --> 02:14:36.278
The truth is beautiful.

1738
02:14:39.448 --> 02:14:41.450
So look at this world...

1739
02:14:43.034 --> 02:14:46.621
and look at what your wish
is costing it.

1740
02:14:47.497 --> 02:14:50.709
You must be the hero.

1741
02:14:51.501 --> 02:14:54.796
Only you can save the day.

1742
02:14:56.506 --> 02:14:58.759
Renounce your wish

1743
02:14:59.509 --> 02:15:01.470
if you want to save this world.

1744
02:15:01.636 --> 02:15:04.014
Why would I...

1745
02:15:04.181 --> 02:15:07.726
when it's finally my turn?

1746
02:15:09.394 --> 02:15:12.898
The world belongs to me!

1747
02:15:13.064 --> 02:15:16.860
You can't stop me. No one can!

1748
02:15:18.403 --> 02:15:20.322
I wasn't talking to you.

1749
02:15:28.205 --> 02:15:31.458
I was talking to everyone else.

1750
02:15:35.879 --> 02:15:38.882
<i>Because you're not the only one
who has suffered.</i>

1751
02:15:40.509 --> 02:15:41.718
<i>Who wants more.</i>

1752
02:15:45.847 --> 02:15:48.850
<i>Who wants them back.</i>

1753
02:15:50.811 --> 02:15:53.647
<i>Who doesn't want to be afraid anymore.</i>

1754
02:15:57.234 --> 02:15:58.568
<i>Or alone.</i>

1755
02:15:59.361 --> 02:16:00.737
<i>Stop!</i>

1756
02:16:00.862 --> 02:16:03.031
Cut the signal! Stop!

1757
02:16:03.198 --> 02:16:05.158
Or frightened.

1758
02:16:05.325 --> 02:16:07.536
Or powerless.

1759
02:16:08.161 --> 02:16:11.665
'Cause you're not the only one
who imagined a world

1760
02:16:11.832 --> 02:16:14.960
where everything was different.

1761
02:16:19.422 --> 02:16:20.742
<i>Better.</i>

1762
02:16:20.799 --> 02:16:23.385
<i>Finally.</i>

1763
02:16:26.930 --> 02:16:31.059
<i>A world where they were loved</i>

1764
02:16:31.226 --> 02:16:34.312
<i>and seen, and appreciated.</i>

1765
02:16:35.021 --> 02:16:36.021
Finally.

1766
02:16:36.022 --> 02:16:37.732
<i>Oh, my God. Who is he?</i>

1767
02:16:38.275 --> 02:16:40.360
He doesn't even speak English.

1768
02:16:40.527 --> 02:16:41.736
What is he eating?

1769
02:16:42.362 --> 02:16:43.405
Look at his shoes!

1770
02:16:44.823 --> 02:16:45.823
Weirdo!

1771
02:17:05.594 --> 02:17:08.680
<i>But what is it costing you?</i>

1772
02:17:09.431 --> 02:17:11.766
Do you see the truth?

1773
02:17:24.029 --> 02:17:25.029
<i>Daddy!</i>

1774
02:17:26.823 --> 02:17:28.533
<i>Daddy!</i>

1775
02:17:38.919 --> 02:17:42.255
The Russians are launching.
We've got orders to counter.

1776
02:17:42.505 --> 02:17:44.174
All right, all right.

1777
02:18:01.858 --> 02:18:03.276
Alistair!

1778
02:18:04.819 --> 02:18:06.179
<i>Emergency alert.</i>

1779
02:18:06.279 --> 02:18:08.323
<i>You have four minutes to find shelter.</i>

1780
02:18:13.787 --> 02:18:15.497
Alistair!

1781
02:18:16.081 --> 02:18:17.415
My son!

1782
02:18:18.541 --> 02:18:21.127
<i>Stay calm and stay indoors.</i>

1783
02:18:21.294 --> 02:18:22.963
Alistair!

1784
02:18:23.129 --> 02:18:25.632
<i>Daddy! Daddy!</i>

1785
02:18:26.091 --> 02:18:27.092
Help me, Daddy!

1786
02:18:27.258 --> 02:18:28.718
<i>This is not a test.</i>

1787
02:18:28.885 --> 02:18:29.928
Daddy!

1788
02:18:32.597 --> 02:18:33.974
<i>Daddy!</i>

1789
02:18:34.224 --> 02:18:35.809
<i>One-minute warning.</i>

1790
02:18:36.977 --> 02:18:38.853
Wait. My son!

1791
02:18:39.020 --> 02:18:40.772
I can see my son!

1792
02:18:40.939 --> 02:18:42.649
Save him, Max.

1793
02:18:44.317 --> 02:18:45.902
I have to save my son.

1794
02:18:46.069 --> 02:18:47.570
<i>Daddy!</i>

1795
02:18:47.696 --> 02:18:48.780
Alistair.

1796
02:18:48.947 --> 02:18:51.157
Daddy!

1797
02:18:51.324 --> 02:18:52.324
Daddy!

1798
02:18:53.076 --> 02:18:55.745
My... Alistair.

1799
02:18:57.163 --> 02:18:59.416
I renounce my wish!

1800
02:19:14.222 --> 02:19:15.765
I renounce my wish.

1801
02:19:19.269 --> 02:19:21.688
We have missiles disappearing, sir.

1802
02:19:22.772 --> 02:19:23.772
Yes, sir.

1803
02:19:23.857 --> 02:19:26.276
<i>They are vanishing from our screen.</i>

1804
02:19:30.071 --> 02:19:32.282
<i>Only just hearing now that a ceasefire</i>

1805
02:19:32.574 --> 02:19:34.826
<i>between the Soviet Union
and the United States</i>

1806
02:19:34.993 --> 02:19:37.495
<i>has averted a global nuclear crisis.</i>

1807
02:19:39.414 --> 02:19:40.999
I renounce my wish.

1808
02:19:59.434 --> 02:20:00.786
- I take back my wish.
- I renounce my wish.

1809
02:20:22.999 --> 02:20:25.126
Alistair!

1810
02:20:31.758 --> 02:20:33.551
Alistair!

1811
02:20:34.094 --> 02:20:36.596
Alistair!

1812
02:20:39.182 --> 02:20:40.182
Daddy!

1813
02:20:46.731 --> 02:20:48.483
- Daddy!
- Alistair!

1814
02:20:52.695 --> 02:20:54.364
Alistair.

1815
02:20:57.700 --> 02:20:59.661
Oh, Alistair, Alistair.

1816
02:20:59.828 --> 02:21:02.080
I'm so sorry, baby.

1817
02:21:04.374 --> 02:21:08.169
I'm so glad I wished you'd come.
I knew it would work.

1818
02:21:11.214 --> 02:21:12.215
No.

1819
02:21:13.466 --> 02:21:15.343
That is not why I'm back.

1820
02:21:16.094 --> 02:21:17.095
No.

1821
02:21:19.139 --> 02:21:21.182
I've been lying to you.

1822
02:21:22.767 --> 02:21:24.811
I'm not a great guy.

1823
02:21:26.104 --> 02:21:28.648
In fact, I'm a pretty messed up,
loser guy.

1824
02:21:30.817 --> 02:21:33.444
And I made terrible mistakes.

1825
02:21:34.404 --> 02:21:36.030
But you...

1826
02:21:38.283 --> 02:21:41.703
you don't ever have to make a wish
for me to love you.

1827
02:21:43.329 --> 02:21:45.707
I'm here because I love you.

1828
02:21:48.126 --> 02:21:50.128
I just...

1829
02:21:50.295 --> 02:21:54.048
I just wish and I pray that, one day,
I'll be able to make you proud enough

1830
02:21:54.215 --> 02:21:56.676
that you'll be able to forgive me.

1831
02:21:58.261 --> 02:22:00.180
And love me.

1832
02:22:00.346 --> 02:22:03.016
Because I'm nothing
to be proud of, Alistair.

1833
02:22:03.308 --> 02:22:06.269
I don't need you to make me proud.

1834
02:22:06.436 --> 02:22:08.730
I already love you, Daddy.

1835
02:22:08.897 --> 02:22:10.982
You're my dad.

1836
02:22:58.112 --> 02:23:00.031
- Sorry. Sorry.
- Sorry.

1837
02:23:00.990 --> 02:23:03.326
It's okay. It's okay.

1838
02:23:08.414 --> 02:23:10.541
So beautiful.

1839
02:23:15.838 --> 02:23:20.176
Sorry.
Just talking to myself.

1840
02:23:22.553 --> 02:23:24.347
It's all right.

1841
02:23:24.514 --> 02:23:25.682
It's just that...

1842
02:23:26.432 --> 02:23:31.187
It's wonderful. It's so many things.

1843
02:23:32.272 --> 02:23:33.690
Yeah.

1844
02:23:34.857 --> 02:23:36.734
I know what you mean.

1845
02:23:42.240 --> 02:23:44.117
I like your...

1846
02:23:44.284 --> 02:23:45.368
I like your outfit.

1847
02:23:46.035 --> 02:23:47.578
You like...

1848
02:23:47.745 --> 02:23:48.746
Thanks.

1849
02:23:48.913 --> 02:23:50.873
You know, my friends...

1850
02:23:51.040 --> 02:23:54.210
they kinda tease me about it,
but it works, right?

1851
02:23:54.377 --> 02:23:55.628
- You look great.
- Thank you.

1852
02:23:56.254 --> 02:23:58.548
You just made my day.

1853
02:24:06.556 --> 02:24:09.267
- Happy holidays. See you around.
- Happy holidays.

1854
02:24:49.349 --> 02:24:52.435
So many things.

1855
02:24:54.979 --> 02:24:58.483
So, so many things.

1856
02:26:34.704 --> 02:26:36.539
- Whoa!
- Look out!

1857
02:26:39.250 --> 02:26:40.668
Oh, my God.

1858
02:26:42.587 --> 02:26:44.297
- Mom, would you take her?
- Yeah.

1859
02:26:44.464 --> 02:26:45.465
Um, excuse me.

1860
02:26:45.715 --> 02:26:49.177
Excuse me. Please, you have to let me
thank you, Miss...

1861
02:26:50.595 --> 02:26:51.804
Asteria.

1862
02:26:51.971 --> 02:26:54.557
Asteria. Wow. That's a beautiful name.

1863
02:26:54.724 --> 02:26:56.267
It's from my culture.

1864
02:26:56.434 --> 02:26:58.644
I can't thank you enough.
I mean, you saved my daughter.

1865
02:26:58.728 --> 02:27:00.563
How did you do that?

1866
02:27:00.730 --> 02:27:04.066
It's just a simple shift of weight.
Takes practice.

1867
02:27:04.734 --> 02:27:07.904
But I've been doing this a long time.
