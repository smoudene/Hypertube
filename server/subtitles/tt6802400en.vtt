1
00:02:08.462 --> 00:02:10.464
Good morning, Mother and Father.

2
00:02:10.548 --> 00:02:12.675
Good morning, Tinashe.

3
00:02:12.758 --> 00:02:14.426
Good morning, Mother and Father.

4
00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:16.262
Good morning, Omma.

5
00:02:16.345 --> 00:02:19.181
Good morning, Mother and Father,
and happy anniversary.

6
00:02:19.265 --> 00:02:21.475
Yes, Meeka.

7
00:02:21.559 --> 00:02:24.144
It is our anniversary.

8
00:02:25.855 --> 00:02:28.190
Today, we celebrate

9
00:02:28.274 --> 00:02:31.777
30 years of Zamundan prosperity,

10
00:02:31.861 --> 00:02:35.531
30 years of service
to our great nation

11
00:02:35.614 --> 00:02:39.535
and 30 years
of delicious fast food.

12
00:02:39.618 --> 00:02:43.122
We want to welcome
you all to McDowell's Zamunda.

13
00:02:46.208 --> 00:02:49.044
The McDowell's menu is in no way

14
00:02:49.128 --> 00:02:51.505
influenced by
the McDonald's menu.

15
00:02:51.589 --> 00:02:53.424
They've got Egg McMuffins.

16
00:02:53.507 --> 00:02:55.301
We've got Egg McStuffins.

17
00:02:55.384 --> 00:02:56.969
We are also celebrating

18
00:02:57.052 --> 00:03:02.391
the arrival of our new
Beyond Big Mick Burger!

19
00:03:02.474 --> 00:03:06.312
And it's all part of my lovely
granddaughter's campaign

20
00:03:06.395 --> 00:03:08.522
to reduce our, uh... our what?

21
00:03:08.606 --> 00:03:10.149
Carbon footprint.

22
00:03:10.232 --> 00:03:13.360
And without using
any animal by-products.

23
00:03:13.444 --> 00:03:16.238
It's just
good old-fashioned grass.

24
00:03:18.449 --> 00:03:20.451
- So there's no meat?
- There's no meat.

25
00:03:22.077 --> 00:03:24.747
Beautiful, leafy taste.

26
00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:26.916
So delicious.

27
00:03:26.999 --> 00:03:29.043
Maybe it would taste
much better with a...

28
00:03:29.126 --> 00:03:31.795
Pepsi.

29
00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:35.799
Pepsi, the official soft drink
of McDowell's Zamunda.

30
00:04:03.661 --> 00:04:05.079
You look tired, Father.

31
00:04:05.162 --> 00:04:07.623
Maybe he needs a nap.

32
00:04:11.001 --> 00:04:13.045
I am the heir
to the throne of Zamunda.

33
00:04:13.128 --> 00:04:15.339
I shall not be shamed
by my two daughters.

34
00:04:15.422 --> 00:04:16.590
Three daughters!

35
00:04:35.693 --> 00:04:37.444
Yeah!

36
00:04:37.528 --> 00:04:40.531
Behold! Prince Akeem
in his natural element,

37
00:04:40.614 --> 00:04:43.826
cowering at the mercy
of the women in his life.

38
00:04:43.909 --> 00:04:45.929
Semmi, perhaps you would like
to spar with my daughters

39
00:04:45.953 --> 00:04:47.538
and teach them
some combinations.

40
00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:49.999
No doubt, you are

41
00:04:50.082 --> 00:04:51.500
their best teacher,
Your Majesty.

42
00:04:51.583 --> 00:04:52.876
It is my daughters that teach me

43
00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:54.270
in the languages
of the modern world.

44
00:04:54.294 --> 00:04:55.921
For instance,

45
00:04:56.005 --> 00:04:57.631
are my princely robes
not on fleek?

46
00:04:57.715 --> 00:05:00.259
Oh, my God, Father.
To be on fleek is no more.

47
00:05:00.342 --> 00:05:01.885
Really?

48
00:05:03.512 --> 00:05:05.014
I rather enjoyed being on fleek.

49
00:05:05.097 --> 00:05:06.557
Your father has sent for you.

50
00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:08.892
He has an urgent matter
to discuss with you.

51
00:05:08.976 --> 00:05:12.021
Tell me, Semmi,
this urgent matter...

52
00:05:12.104 --> 00:05:14.648
does it concern
my marriage to a suitor

53
00:05:14.732 --> 00:05:17.151
who shall one day sit
on the throne of Zamunda?

54
00:05:17.234 --> 00:05:19.028
I will talk to Father alone.

55
00:05:24.324 --> 00:05:26.452
And how is my father today?

56
00:05:26.535 --> 00:05:29.079
He has already ordered
my execution three times.

57
00:05:29.163 --> 00:05:31.415
Oh, then he must be
feeling better.

58
00:05:31.498 --> 00:05:32.666
Prince Akeem!

59
00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:34.418
Nexdorian soldiers.

60
00:05:34.501 --> 00:05:36.462
I could not stop.
They are coming.

61
00:05:55.981 --> 00:06:01.528
Presenting the supreme leader
of Nexdoria,

62
00:06:01.612 --> 00:06:04.865
the conqueror of countries
and hearts...

63
00:06:06.033 --> 00:06:07.910
...the wrestler of lions,

64
00:06:07.993 --> 00:06:10.079
the tamer of elephants,

65
00:06:10.162 --> 00:06:12.664
the inspiration for Mufasa...

66
00:06:16.126 --> 00:06:21.423
...the most well-endowed man
in Africa,

67
00:06:21.507 --> 00:06:24.051
General...

68
00:06:24.134 --> 00:06:26.386
Izzi.

69
00:06:38.649 --> 00:06:41.485
Prince Akeem.

70
00:06:41.568 --> 00:06:43.487
Whoa, look at you.

71
00:06:46.073 --> 00:06:51.036
My condolences this day
for your father, the king.

72
00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:53.914
Many thanks for your
well wishes, General Izzi,

73
00:06:53.997 --> 00:06:56.291
but as you know,
my father still breathes.

74
00:06:56.375 --> 00:06:59.670
Barely, but for how long?

75
00:06:59.753 --> 00:07:01.380
Why have you come here, General?

76
00:07:01.463 --> 00:07:03.841
30 years ago,
you left my sister at the altar.

77
00:07:03.924 --> 00:07:05.300
Oh, here we go.

78
00:07:05.384 --> 00:07:06.385
Now look at she.

79
00:07:12.182 --> 00:07:14.685
Imani, always a pleasure.

80
00:07:16.228 --> 00:07:20.482
If you had married her,
our countries would be united,

81
00:07:20.566 --> 00:07:23.735
putting an end to decades
of suffering for all our people.

82
00:07:23.819 --> 00:07:25.362
General, throughout the years,

83
00:07:25.445 --> 00:07:27.990
we have tried to help
Nexdoria many times.

84
00:07:28.073 --> 00:07:30.951
I would like nothing more
than to help your country

85
00:07:31.034 --> 00:07:32.828
relieve its burden of poverty.

86
00:07:32.911 --> 00:07:36.081
Zamunda can only afford so much.

87
00:07:36.165 --> 00:07:38.625
I did not come here for money.

88
00:07:38.709 --> 00:07:41.128
I came here for blood.

89
00:07:43.505 --> 00:07:45.299
But not the murder kind.

90
00:07:45.382 --> 00:07:47.801
No, no, no, family blood.

91
00:07:47.885 --> 00:07:50.220
Marriage blood, yes?

92
00:07:51.930 --> 00:07:57.060
Has your daughter considered
the proposal from my son?

93
00:07:57.144 --> 00:07:59.396
Hey, Prince-o.

94
00:07:59.479 --> 00:08:01.148
My fellow player.

95
00:08:01.231 --> 00:08:02.858
Hey!

96
00:08:02.941 --> 00:08:04.860
Yes.

97
00:08:04.943 --> 00:08:07.946
I do not think that he and Meeka
will ever happen.

98
00:08:10.199 --> 00:08:12.409
Ever.

99
00:08:17.331 --> 00:08:20.667
There is Bopoto, my daughter.

100
00:08:20.751 --> 00:08:22.544
Perhaps your son can be...

101
00:08:22.628 --> 00:08:24.296
Uh, ay...

102
00:08:24.379 --> 00:08:26.465
But you don't have one.

103
00:08:26.548 --> 00:08:28.634
The shame must be unbearable,

104
00:08:28.717 --> 00:08:31.094
as a man, as a king,

105
00:08:31.178 --> 00:08:33.972
without an heir with a nut sack.

106
00:08:36.642 --> 00:08:39.144
Thank you for your visit,
General.

107
00:08:39.228 --> 00:08:40.938
Seeing you brings to mind

108
00:08:41.021 --> 00:08:43.190
all of my father's
favorite curses for you.

109
00:08:44.775 --> 00:08:48.153
To call you a shit stain
brought him much joy.

110
00:08:48.237 --> 00:08:51.031
I advise you
to reconsider my offer.

111
00:08:51.114 --> 00:08:54.618
It is better to be bound
by blood and marriage

112
00:08:54.701 --> 00:08:58.997
than be divided
by blood and war.

113
00:09:00.791 --> 00:09:02.459
Eh?

114
00:09:04.711 --> 00:09:06.505
Hey!

115
00:09:14.263 --> 00:09:17.266
My time has come, my son.

116
00:09:17.349 --> 00:09:21.895
You must heed my words
before I'm gone.

117
00:09:21.979 --> 00:09:23.739
Please don't leave us so soon,
Your Highness.

118
00:09:23.814 --> 00:09:25.148
Zamunda needs you.

119
00:09:25.232 --> 00:09:27.025
Oh, shut up, Semmi!

120
00:09:27.109 --> 00:09:29.278
You don't have to suck up
to me anymore.

121
00:09:29.361 --> 00:09:30.821
I'll be dead soon.

122
00:09:30.904 --> 00:09:33.407
Why couldn't it be you, Semmi?

123
00:09:33.490 --> 00:09:34.783
Yes, Your Majesty.

124
00:09:34.866 --> 00:09:36.868
His life is far too worthless.

125
00:09:36.952 --> 00:09:39.913
His death would make me smile.

126
00:09:39.997 --> 00:09:41.206
Baba.

127
00:09:43.375 --> 00:09:45.794
The throne must pass
to a male heir.

128
00:09:45.877 --> 00:09:47.212
Yes, Father.

129
00:09:47.296 --> 00:09:48.672
A male heir.

130
00:09:49.673 --> 00:09:51.383
Once again, I apologize to you

131
00:09:51.466 --> 00:09:54.011
for all of the shame
and disappointment

132
00:09:54.094 --> 00:09:56.555
that my offspring's
genetic makeup has caused you.

133
00:09:56.638 --> 00:10:01.768
My son, it appears
your shortcomings in masculinity

134
00:10:01.852 --> 00:10:04.104
have turned out to be unfounded.

135
00:10:04.187 --> 00:10:06.273
I seen it

136
00:10:06.356 --> 00:10:08.150
in a vision.

137
00:10:09.526 --> 00:10:11.528
You gots a son.

138
00:10:13.947 --> 00:10:15.115
It is true.

139
00:10:16.283 --> 00:10:18.702
You have a son, Akeem.

140
00:10:20.704 --> 00:10:22.205
A bastard son.

141
00:10:22.289 --> 00:10:24.291
That is impossible.

142
00:10:24.374 --> 00:10:27.252
The only woman
I have ever lain with is Lisa.

143
00:10:27.336 --> 00:10:30.922
Father, I did not sow
my royal oats.

144
00:10:32.966 --> 00:10:34.343
Semmi!

145
00:10:34.426 --> 00:10:35.761
Hmm?

146
00:10:35.844 --> 00:10:38.263
Tell Akeem the truth at once.

147
00:10:42.267 --> 00:10:46.146
Remember in Queens,
night after night,

148
00:10:46.229 --> 00:10:48.315
you were looking
for the perfect woman?

149
00:10:48.398 --> 00:10:49.775
Yes.

150
00:10:49.858 --> 00:10:53.153
Well, I too was...
how can I say this?

151
00:10:54.738 --> 00:10:57.908
I was looking
for the perfect vagina.

152
00:11:00.452 --> 00:11:01.953
Or any vagina.

153
00:11:03.622 --> 00:11:07.084
We scoured the far reaches
of that loathsome city,

154
00:11:07.167 --> 00:11:09.753
searching rather unsuccessfully
for the woman of your dreams.

155
00:11:09.836 --> 00:11:12.464
♪ My name is Peaches,
and I'm the best ♪

156
00:11:12.547 --> 00:11:15.008
♪ All the DJs want
to feel my breast. ♪

157
00:11:15.092 --> 00:11:17.511
I've been
watching you all evening,

158
00:11:17.594 --> 00:11:19.971
and I want to tear you apart.

159
00:11:21.181 --> 00:11:22.974
And your friend, too.

160
00:11:25.727 --> 00:11:27.354
I am going to mingle.

161
00:11:27.437 --> 00:11:29.689
I had had enough.

162
00:11:29.773 --> 00:11:32.776
And I realized, if I was ever
going to sow my oats

163
00:11:32.859 --> 00:11:34.319
on American soil,

164
00:11:34.403 --> 00:11:36.238
I was going to need
to find someone

165
00:11:36.321 --> 00:11:37.823
to take care of you.

166
00:11:37.906 --> 00:11:40.367
But don't worry,
I never broke our oath

167
00:11:40.450 --> 00:11:42.452
of keeping our identity
a secret.

168
00:11:42.536 --> 00:11:44.121
A prince?

169
00:11:45.163 --> 00:11:47.165
Yes, a prince.

170
00:11:47.249 --> 00:11:50.710
But he cannot know
that you know who he is.

171
00:11:50.794 --> 00:11:54.214
We are undercover Africans.

172
00:11:54.297 --> 00:11:57.050
Africans undercover.
Oh, that's good, baby.

173
00:11:57.134 --> 00:11:59.886
You ain't got to lie like that
to get some of this ass.

174
00:11:59.970 --> 00:12:01.906
But you know what? I'll bump
uglies with your homeboy.

175
00:12:01.930 --> 00:12:04.516
Just let me go throw up
real quick, and, uh...

176
00:12:04.599 --> 00:12:07.561
and then we can, you know,
get it crackin'.

177
00:12:07.644 --> 00:12:11.231
♪ Let your soul glow... ♪

178
00:12:11.314 --> 00:12:13.859
I may not have been
thinking straight.

179
00:12:13.942 --> 00:12:16.027
In my defense, it had been weeks

180
00:12:16.111 --> 00:12:19.364
since the last time I was
tended to by the royal bathers.

181
00:12:19.448 --> 00:12:22.325
But at the time,
it seemed like a good plan.

182
00:12:25.454 --> 00:12:27.205
Mmm.

183
00:12:27.289 --> 00:12:30.917
I hope you like, uh,
pumpkin pie.

184
00:12:31.001 --> 00:12:34.629
'Cause you gonna get
a whole slice.

185
00:12:36.965 --> 00:12:39.426
That is not what happened,
Father.

186
00:12:39.509 --> 00:12:42.179
I remember meeting
this morally bereft woman,

187
00:12:42.262 --> 00:12:44.431
but there was
no inappropriate mating.

188
00:12:44.514 --> 00:12:46.600
She offered me
some of her ceremonial herbs.

189
00:12:50.687 --> 00:12:51.938
Princey.

190
00:12:52.022 --> 00:12:53.773
And then, if memory serves,

191
00:12:53.857 --> 00:12:55.692
a wild boar burst into the room.

192
00:12:55.775 --> 00:12:58.028
It came and jumped into my lap.

193
00:12:58.111 --> 00:12:59.738
And then it began to ram me.

194
00:12:59.821 --> 00:13:02.491
And ram me and ram me, ramming and ramming!

195
00:13:02.574 --> 00:13:04.367
And a foul...

196
00:13:12.042 --> 00:13:13.793
You fool,
what have you done to me?!

197
00:13:13.877 --> 00:13:15.462
Go on, son.

198
00:13:15.545 --> 00:13:16.625
- Just kill him.
- Kill him!

199
00:13:19.299 --> 00:13:21.343
- So I actually have a son?
- A bastard son.

200
00:13:23.929 --> 00:13:26.848
Why was his existence
hidden from me all these years?

201
00:13:26.932 --> 00:13:31.353
I was hoping you would put
a stem on an apple of your own.

202
00:13:31.436 --> 00:13:36.149
The royal artist made a sketch
of my vision.

203
00:13:37.776 --> 00:13:40.487
This is your bastard.

204
00:13:40.570 --> 00:13:42.531
Hear me, Prince Akeem.

205
00:13:42.614 --> 00:13:46.284
General Izzi, he will use
the passing of our great king

206
00:13:46.368 --> 00:13:49.329
as a sign
to attack the weak one.

207
00:13:49.412 --> 00:13:51.873
The weak one?

208
00:13:51.957 --> 00:13:53.708
Am I the weak one?

209
00:13:53.792 --> 00:13:56.461
I spoiled you, my son.

210
00:13:56.545 --> 00:14:01.049
You are not strong
or ruthless as I am.

211
00:14:01.132 --> 00:14:03.426
You will be assassinated.

212
00:14:06.137 --> 00:14:07.389
Within a week.

213
00:14:07.472 --> 00:14:09.140
Month, tops.

214
00:14:09.224 --> 00:14:12.394
Prince Akeem,
follow the thunderbird.

215
00:14:12.477 --> 00:14:14.437
It will take you to your boy.

216
00:14:14.521 --> 00:14:15.897
Follow the thunderbird?

217
00:14:15.981 --> 00:14:17.440
This is madness.

218
00:14:17.524 --> 00:14:19.377
If my family were to ever
find out about this...

219
00:14:19.401 --> 00:14:21.111
You will be safe.

220
00:14:21.194 --> 00:14:24.072
Our people will be safe.

221
00:14:24.155 --> 00:14:27.492
It is the only way. You must.

222
00:14:34.416 --> 00:14:35.667
Easy, my father.

223
00:14:35.750 --> 00:14:38.086
The end is near.

224
00:14:39.713 --> 00:14:41.923
My funeral...

225
00:14:42.007 --> 00:14:44.718
should be spectacular.

226
00:14:46.845 --> 00:14:48.638
Yeah, it will, Papa.

227
00:14:48.722 --> 00:14:53.226
Let's have it now
while I'm alive.

228
00:14:55.020 --> 00:14:57.063
It shall be glorious.

229
00:14:59.149 --> 00:15:01.192
In the beginning,

230
00:15:01.276 --> 00:15:02.319
the universe began.

231
00:15:02.402 --> 00:15:06.031
Stars, planets,

232
00:15:06.114 --> 00:15:08.074
all the visible objects
in the universe

233
00:15:08.158 --> 00:15:12.746
came to be
with a single purpose:

234
00:15:12.829 --> 00:15:16.791
to prepare the way for
the grandest creation of all,

235
00:15:16.875 --> 00:15:19.753
the birth of Jaffe Joffer.

236
00:15:25.592 --> 00:15:26.801
But today,

237
00:15:26.885 --> 00:15:30.096
we gather for a moment or two

238
00:15:30.180 --> 00:15:32.390
to give much respect due

239
00:15:32.474 --> 00:15:36.353
to the king who made
a difference in our world.

240
00:15:36.436 --> 00:15:40.649
Zamundans, I give you...

Soon, Nexdorian warriors
will assassinate me.

304
00:18:58.054 --> 00:19:01.140
And I have a child
on the other side of the world.

305

Take heart in your grief.

306
00:19:03.268 --> 00:19:04.602
You are king now.

307
00:19:04.686 --> 00:19:05.937
Be as your father.

308
00:19:06.020 --> 00:19:07.522
Bark orders at me.

309
00:19:07.605 --> 00:19:09.858
Throw things at me.
It will make you happy.

310
00:19:14.821 --> 00:19:17.031
Prepare the royal jet.

311
00:19:18.700 --> 00:19:20.910
We are going back to America.

312
00:19:22.787 --> 00:19:24.622
Oh, hell no, Your Majesty!

313
00:19:24.706 --> 00:19:26.541
Now, I will find
this bastard of Queens,

314
00:19:26.624 --> 00:19:28.751
and I will look into his eyes,
and if I see

315
00:19:28.835 --> 00:19:31.504
the strength of our ancestors,
I shall know he is of my blood.

316
00:19:31.588 --> 00:19:33.548
Then he must come back
to Zamunda

317
00:19:33.631 --> 00:19:35.216
and take the princely test.

318
00:19:35.300 --> 00:19:37.969
Heir to the throne of Zamunda,

319
00:19:38.052 --> 00:19:40.138
born in America...

320
00:19:41.890 --> 00:19:43.892
...land of opportunity.

321
00:19:46.895 --> 00:19:49.188
What kind of man
do you think he is?

322
00:19:49.272 --> 00:19:51.858
This bastard.

323
00:19:51.941 --> 00:19:55.028
If he has Joffer blood
running through his veins,

324
00:19:55.111 --> 00:19:58.197
I'm sure he's destined
for greatness.

325
00:20:06.164 --> 00:20:08.082
You think you look respectable?

326
00:20:08.166 --> 00:20:09.792
I just want to look employable.

327
00:20:09.876 --> 00:20:11.516
Ain't nobody gonna hire you
over all these

328
00:20:11.586 --> 00:20:13.129
Mitt-Romney-looking-ass
shmiggas.

329
00:20:13.212 --> 00:20:15.882
Why not? I got sales experience.

330
00:20:15.965 --> 00:20:17.967
Which reminds me...
St. John's is at the Garden.

331
00:20:18.051 --> 00:20:19.969
Now, I want you to take
these tickets up there.

332
00:20:20.053 --> 00:20:21.971
Sell 'em at full freight
until tip-off.

333
00:20:22.055 --> 00:20:24.766
I can't do this shit
no more, man. I really can't.

334
00:20:24.849 --> 00:20:27.310
This hand-to-mouth shit,
it's got to stop, all right?

335
00:20:27.393 --> 00:20:28.645
I got to get solid.

336
00:20:28.728 --> 00:20:30.063
I'm in my 30s now.

337
00:20:30.146 --> 00:20:31.689
Since when?

338
00:20:31.773 --> 00:20:33.107
Today!

339
00:20:34.108 --> 00:20:35.693
Today.

340
00:20:35.777 --> 00:20:37.236
Today is my birthday.

341
00:20:37.320 --> 00:20:38.863
And you forgot.

342
00:20:38.947 --> 00:20:41.741
Listen to me, young Jedi, okay?

343
00:20:41.824 --> 00:20:43.618
What you need to do
is learn to relax.

344
00:20:43.701 --> 00:20:45.244
I'm your uncle.

345
00:20:45.328 --> 00:20:47.455
You stay on the ground with me.
You dig it, son?

346
00:20:47.538 --> 00:20:48.665
Uh, L. Junson.

347
00:20:48.748 --> 00:20:51.376
Don't use white voice.

348
00:20:51.459 --> 00:20:53.002
Present.

349
00:20:54.295 --> 00:20:55.672
I do know smartphones.

350
00:20:55.755 --> 00:20:57.507
I know technology, all right?

351
00:20:57.590 --> 00:21:00.259
I'm well-versed
in emerging trends.

352
00:21:00.343 --> 00:21:02.595
And I'll tell you this, too.

353
00:21:02.679 --> 00:21:05.348
If you hire me,
I won't let you down.

354
00:21:05.431 --> 00:21:07.308
That's really inspiring.

355
00:21:07.392 --> 00:21:09.936
So, uh, just give me a chance,
Mr. Duke.

356
00:21:10.019 --> 00:21:11.938
Oh, my God, please.
My father is Mr. Duke.

357
00:21:12.021 --> 00:21:14.857
Uh, and my, uh, grandfather
and great-uncle,

358
00:21:14.941 --> 00:21:17.193
who founded Duke &amp; Duke.

359
00:21:17.276 --> 00:21:19.237
- Uh, please just call me Calvin.
- All right.

360
00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:20.488
I'm calling you Calvin.

361
00:21:20.571 --> 00:21:23.282
I noticed here,
under education, that...

362
00:21:23.366 --> 00:21:26.035
did it say that
you-you didn't graduate college?

363
00:21:26.119 --> 00:21:27.759
Well, yeah, see,
I was three credits short

364
00:21:27.787 --> 00:21:29.139
from getting my, uh,
business degree,

365
00:21:29.163 --> 00:21:30.915
but then my mom got laid off,
and, uh,

366
00:21:30.999 --> 00:21:33.626
you know, I had to, uh,
drop out to help with the rent.

367
00:21:33.710 --> 00:21:36.129
- Is she addicted to drugs or...
- What?

368
00:21:36.212 --> 00:21:38.506
- She have gambling issues or...
- No, man.

369
00:21:38.589 --> 00:21:40.842
Pops, uh, in the picture or...

370
00:21:42.176 --> 00:21:44.595
- My dad was not in the picture.
- Ah.

371
00:21:45.930 --> 00:21:47.390
You know, I went
to boarding school,

372
00:21:47.473 --> 00:21:49.058
so there were months
where I didn't see

373
00:21:49.142 --> 00:21:52.228
my parents, except for breaks,
and, uh, it can be hard.

374
00:21:52.311 --> 00:21:55.440
I mean, I've read
a lot of studies that say

375
00:21:55.523 --> 00:21:57.900
that not having
a dominant male figure at home,

376
00:21:57.984 --> 00:22:00.028
it's so detrimental to a child.

377
00:22:00.111 --> 00:22:02.613
- Do they say that?
- Yeah, they say that.

378
00:22:02.697 --> 00:22:04.490
- Who?
- Scientists.

379
00:22:04.574 --> 00:22:06.951
- Bill Nye did a...
- The Science Guy.

380
00:22:07.035 --> 00:22:08.536
Your guy, uh,
Neil deGrasse Tyson.

381
00:22:08.619 --> 00:22:10.830
Do you think that not having

382
00:22:10.913 --> 00:22:15.418
that kind of male role model
could put you at a disadvantage?

383
00:22:15.501 --> 00:22:18.629
No more of a disadvantage
than having a father

384
00:22:18.713 --> 00:22:20.673
who handed you your position.

385
00:22:20.757 --> 00:22:22.175
"Handed"?

386
00:22:22.258 --> 00:22:24.719
I-I was not handed anything.

387
00:22:24.802 --> 00:22:26.971
So you're saying
Daddy never donated a building

388
00:22:27.055 --> 00:22:29.015
to get you into
an Ivy League school?

389
00:22:29.098 --> 00:22:30.641
No. Yeah.

390
00:22:30.725 --> 00:22:33.519
Well, there was
a small off-campus library.

391
00:22:33.603 --> 00:22:36.064
And Daddy never
had to sneak you into

392
00:22:36.147 --> 00:22:38.024
an overpriced rehab facility

393
00:22:38.107 --> 00:22:40.109
to cover up
a cocaine addiction, Calvin?

394
00:22:40.193 --> 00:22:42.403
It was oxy, and my mom took me.

395
00:22:44.405 --> 00:22:45.782
Kiss my ass, Calvin.

396
00:22:45.865 --> 00:22:47.200
Hey, you know something?

397
00:22:47.283 --> 00:22:48.927
You've been judging me
since I walked in here.

398
00:22:48.951 --> 00:22:51.537
Which sucks because
I am so motivated.

399
00:22:51.621 --> 00:22:53.474
You know what, I-I just
can't wait for them to find

400
00:22:53.498 --> 00:22:55.875
blackface photos of you
from the office party.

401
00:22:55.958 --> 00:22:58.795
I was
Will Smith's Aladdin, okay?

402
00:22:58.878 --> 00:23:00.296
Peace, Calvin.

403
00:23:00.379 --> 00:23:02.298
There was blueface
over the black...

Floyd "Money"
Mayweather ain't shit!

416
00:23:40.795 --> 00:23:42.421
He beat that Filipino boy ass.

417
00:23:42.505 --> 00:23:44.298
"Pack-a-quando," "Pack-a-mondo."

418
00:23:44.382 --> 00:23:47.593
Wh-Whatever his name is,
he beat that boy ass, Clarence.

419
00:23:47.677 --> 00:23:51.180
And he beat that meshuggener
Conor McGregor, the Irishman.

420
00:23:51.264 --> 00:23:53.558
Yeah, 'cause he had to do that
for the blacks.

421
00:23:53.641 --> 00:23:55.619
In this political climate,
Black man can't be taking

422
00:23:55.643 --> 00:23:56.978
no ass-whipping
from no white man.

423
00:23:57.061 --> 00:23:58.104
Would've caused a riot.

424
00:23:58.187 --> 00:23:59.397
I was ready to riot anyway.

425
00:23:59.480 --> 00:24:01.208
I wanted to get me
one of them flat-screen TVs.

426
00:24:05.945 --> 00:24:08.573
Well, I'll be damned!
Look who done come up in here.

427
00:24:08.656 --> 00:24:11.701
Hey, it's Kunta Kinte and Ebola.

428
00:24:11.784 --> 00:24:14.328
- Famine and Blood Diamond.
- Nelson Mandela and Winnie.

429
00:24:16.956 --> 00:24:18.559
Those hungry babies
with the flies on their face.

430
00:24:18.583 --> 00:24:20.223
- Hey. Oh, oh, oh, oh.
- Whoa, whoa.

431
00:24:20.251 --> 00:24:21.770
That's too much, man.
You stepped over the line, now.

432
00:24:21.794 --> 00:24:23.272
We don't be talking that kind
of shit about the hungry babies.

433
00:24:23.296 --> 00:24:25.315
You gonna have to get out my
chair talking that kind of shit.

434
00:24:25.339 --> 00:24:26.674
Politically incorrect.

435
00:24:26.757 --> 00:24:28.467
Somebody need to whip your ass.

436
00:24:28.551 --> 00:24:30.511
Mm-hmm.
Get up and whip him, Sweets.

437
00:24:30.595 --> 00:24:32.364
Hey, don't be putting the money
in my hand all rough.

438
00:24:32.388 --> 00:24:33.866
Take your ass out of here.
You buy you a Flowbee

439
00:24:33.890 --> 00:24:35.433
and cut your own damn hair
from now on.

440
00:24:35.516 --> 00:24:37.977
Right now I could rip
a new ass in that kid.

441
00:24:38.060 --> 00:24:39.103
It is so good to see you.

442
00:24:39.187 --> 00:24:41.105
Your neighborhood
seems to be thriving.

443
00:24:41.189 --> 00:24:42.332
Oh, that's that gentrification.

444
00:24:42.356 --> 00:24:43.941
You know,
when the colored man here,

445
00:24:44.025 --> 00:24:45.335
this neighborhood
didn't have shit.

446
00:24:45.359 --> 00:24:46.986
When the white man move in,

447
00:24:47.069 --> 00:24:49.447
they got their coffeehouses
and their dog parks,

448
00:24:49.530 --> 00:24:53.159
and my brownstone on Foch
Boulevard is worth $10 million.

449
00:24:53.242 --> 00:24:55.828
Your brownstone ain't worth
no ten million.

450
00:24:55.912 --> 00:24:57.598
My brownstone is, too, worth $10 million!

451
00:24:57.622 --> 00:25:00.166
And I'm gonna sell it
and get me a Tesla.

452
00:25:00.249 --> 00:25:02.019
America has certainly changed
since our last visit.

453
00:25:02.043 --> 00:25:05.880
Your Black president finally
united this great country.

454
00:25:05.963 --> 00:25:07.590
Yeah, but it's all
gone to hell now.

455
00:25:07.673 --> 00:25:10.218
We all gonna die.
Just don't know how.

456
00:25:10.301 --> 00:25:11.802
It's gonna be the Nazis.

457
00:25:11.886 --> 00:25:13.471
Nazis are back,

458
00:25:13.554 --> 00:25:16.224
but now they dress
like the Best Buy Geek Squad

459
00:25:16.307 --> 00:25:18.351
and they want to kill people.

460
00:25:18.434 --> 00:25:21.896
Anybody could be a Nazi.
You ever notice that, Prince?

461
00:25:21.979 --> 00:25:23.814
Akeem now is an African king.

462
00:25:23.898 --> 00:25:25.098
Well, I'll be damned.

463
00:25:25.149 --> 00:25:27.735
You got any kids? I got kids.

464
00:25:27.818 --> 00:25:30.947
In fact, I got one granddaughter
used to be my grandson.

465
00:25:31.030 --> 00:25:33.407
They can turn your penis
into a vagina now.

466
00:25:34.533 --> 00:25:35.785
It's science.

467
00:25:35.868 --> 00:25:37.328
I bet they could fix

468
00:25:37.411 --> 00:25:39.372
them long, sloppy titties
y'all got in Africa.

469
00:25:39.455 --> 00:25:40.957
You can't even
squeeze a tit nowadays.

470
00:25:41.040 --> 00:25:42.291
It'll get you fired.

471
00:25:42.375 --> 00:25:44.418
I'm so sorry you can
no longer indiscriminately

472
00:25:44.502 --> 00:25:46.545
touch a woman's body
at your every whim.

473
00:25:46.629 --> 00:25:49.006
Oh, it's okay.
I got it in when I was young.

474
00:25:55.096 --> 00:25:57.682
So what you doing back here,
Idiot Amin?

475
00:25:57.765 --> 00:25:59.475
I am actually here
with a purpose.

476
00:25:59.558 --> 00:26:02.019
I have just discovered
that I may have a bastard son

477
00:26:02.103 --> 00:26:04.397
here in this land,
conceived during my last visit.

478
00:26:04.480 --> 00:26:08.025
The long arm of the family court
bring 'em back every time.

479
00:26:08.109 --> 00:26:10.653
How much child support
she getting from you?

480
00:26:10.736 --> 00:26:12.280
The king pays no child support.

481
00:26:12.363 --> 00:26:15.533
No child support for 30 years,
and you came back?

482
00:26:15.616 --> 00:26:17.618
You's a dummy!

483
00:26:17.702 --> 00:26:20.663
My son has been without a father
for far too long.

484
00:26:21.872 --> 00:26:23.416
I've seen him.

485
00:26:23.499 --> 00:26:25.793
That's the kid that's always
out in front of the Garden.

486
00:26:25.876 --> 00:26:27.716
He scalp tickets
down at Madison Square Garden.

487
00:26:27.795 --> 00:26:30.423
He probably over there right now
working the St. John's game.

488
00:26:30.506 --> 00:26:32.008
Their mascot is a big turkey.

489
00:26:32.091 --> 00:26:34.552
Oh, hell no, it ain't.
It's a thunderbird.

490
00:26:36.387 --> 00:26:38.306
"Follow the thunderbird."

491
00:26:38.389 --> 00:26:40.016
Hey! Come on, y'all!

492
00:26:40.099 --> 00:26:42.810
I got five! Got five!

493
00:26:42.893 --> 00:26:46.105
Got five tickets to the
Middle Tennessee game tonight!

494
00:26:46.188 --> 00:26:49.150
Come on, y'all!
You want it, I got it!

495
00:26:49.233 --> 00:26:50.873
Hey, I got five...
Hey, I got five tickets

496
00:26:50.943 --> 00:26:52.087
to the Middle Tennessee State
game, man.

497
00:26:52.111 --> 00:26:53.446
- No.
- Come on, yo.

498
00:26:53.529 --> 00:26:55.729
What better way to spend
your night than paying to watch

499
00:26:55.781 --> 00:26:56.907
unpaid student athletes?

500
00:27:00.077 --> 00:27:01.370
Semmi, look.

501
00:27:04.415 --> 00:27:07.043
It is my potential bastard son.

502
00:27:08.169 --> 00:27:09.462
Akeem.

503
00:27:09.545 --> 00:27:11.088
You are king of Zamunda.

504
00:27:11.172 --> 00:27:13.591
Your noble visage is known
around the world.

505
00:27:13.674 --> 00:27:17.928
You cannot stroll down the
street like we did years ago.

506
00:27:19.889 --> 00:27:21.640
Come on, Middle Tennessee State.

507
00:27:21.724 --> 00:27:23.059
Come on, y'all.

508
00:27:23.142 --> 00:27:25.269
They got
a seven-foot-five center.

509
00:27:25.353 --> 00:27:27.563
Catch him before his knees pop.

510
00:27:30.191 --> 00:27:31.942
Hello.

511
00:27:33.444 --> 00:27:34.987
You want some tickets, man?

512
00:27:35.071 --> 00:27:36.697
No, thank you.

513
00:27:38.282 --> 00:27:42.036
I am King Akeem Joffer,
king of Zamunda.

514
00:27:42.119 --> 00:27:44.121
And I believe that you...

515
00:27:45.748 --> 00:27:47.291
What is your name?

516
00:27:47.375 --> 00:27:49.752
It's Lavelle.

517
00:27:49.835 --> 00:27:52.588
- Lavelle Junson.
- ...Lavelle Junson,

518
00:27:52.671 --> 00:27:55.383
are the heir
to the throne of Zamunda.

519
00:27:56.801 --> 00:28:00.679
My firstborn child
and my only son.

520
00:28:02.223 --> 00:28:05.226
Yes, my son.

521
00:28:05.309 --> 00:28:07.228
Are you putting
the candles on the cake?

522
00:28:07.311 --> 00:28:10.398
31 candles.
I need 31 candles on that cake.

523
00:28:10.481 --> 00:28:12.000
Oh, well, there's only ten
in the pack, so...

524
00:28:12.024 --> 00:28:14.527
What do you mean, only ten?
Why is there only ten?

525
00:28:14.610 --> 00:28:16.171
'Cause I did not have
enough change left over

526
00:28:16.195 --> 00:28:17.446
to get another pack of candles.

527
00:28:17.530 --> 00:28:19.031
It's your nephew's birthday.

528
00:28:19.115 --> 00:28:20.467
Look, just please try
to make 31 candles.

529
00:28:20.491 --> 00:28:22.451
Cut the candles in half.

530
00:28:22.535 --> 00:28:24.495
That's just 20. It's...

531
00:28:26.038 --> 00:28:27.248
Cuzzo! Happy birthday!

532
00:28:27.331 --> 00:28:30.000
Happy birthday!

533
00:28:30.084 --> 00:28:31.419
Happy birthday, cuz!

534
00:28:31.502 --> 00:28:33.254
Hey, baby, happy birthday!

535
00:28:38.342 --> 00:28:40.636
Oh, my God.

536
00:28:40.719 --> 00:28:42.304
My African.

537
00:28:42.388 --> 00:28:44.181
I told you
he was gonna come back!

538
00:28:44.265 --> 00:28:46.475
Boy, why you ain't tell me
you was bringing company?

539
00:28:46.559 --> 00:28:48.239
- I would've cleaned up.
- Uh-huh.

540
00:28:48.310 --> 00:28:50.771
- So you know this man?
- I definitely know this man.

541
00:28:50.855 --> 00:28:52.398
I know this man
all the way live.

542
00:28:52.481 --> 00:28:54.567
You know, I know this man
all up in the crevice.

543
00:28:54.650 --> 00:28:56.777
Yes, it's, uh,

544
00:28:56.861 --> 00:28:58.863
very good to see you again...

545
00:29:01.657 --> 00:29:04.160
- Mary.
- Mary.

546
00:29:04.243 --> 00:29:06.412
- Like the Virgin.
- Oh. Okay, baby. All right.

547
00:29:06.495 --> 00:29:08.456
- Virgin? Not our Mary.
- She ain't no virgin.

548
00:29:08.539 --> 00:29:10.308
- You know that.
- You know what? That's right.

549
00:29:10.332 --> 00:29:11.768
Y'all was doing
that little weak pickup game.

550
00:29:11.792 --> 00:29:13.878
I think he was
supposed to be, like,

551
00:29:13.961 --> 00:29:15.588
the prince or something.

552
00:29:15.671 --> 00:29:17.214
He is not a prince anymore.

553
00:29:17.298 --> 00:29:18.757
He is our king.

554
00:29:18.841 --> 00:29:21.635
- Oh, he's a king now.
- A king?

555
00:29:21.719 --> 00:29:23.679
Oh, okay, King.

556
00:29:23.762 --> 00:29:26.849
So, you still got that smooth...
scepter?

557
00:29:26.932 --> 00:29:28.100
Hey.

558
00:29:28.184 --> 00:29:30.519
No. Nobody want to hear that
on my birthday.

559
00:29:30.603 --> 00:29:32.789
- - Mary. Mary.
- Yo, Mom, for real,

560
00:29:32.813 --> 00:29:33.939
is this dude my father?

561
00:29:34.023 --> 00:29:36.317
Father? Boy...

562
00:29:37.401 --> 00:29:38.569
Mm.

563
00:29:39.737 --> 00:29:42.114
Oh, boy, yeah, that might...
he might be.

564
00:29:42.198 --> 00:29:44.366
He does... Y'all know
I was a ho, though, right?

565
00:29:44.450 --> 00:29:46.118
Y'all know I was
out in these streets?

566
00:29:46.202 --> 00:29:47.637
- You was a ho.
- I wasn't selling it.

567
00:29:47.661 --> 00:29:48.763
I should've been selling it.

568
00:29:48.787 --> 00:29:50.456
In one of them
Fashion Nova dresses.

569
00:29:50.539 --> 00:29:52.350
- 'Cause I was giving it away, for sure.
- Mary.

570
00:29:52.374 --> 00:29:53.918
I've come back for my son.

571
00:29:54.001 --> 00:29:57.379
To have him take his
rightful place on the throne.

572
00:29:57.463 --> 00:29:58.964
Ain't nothing happening.

573
00:29:59.048 --> 00:30:01.234
Zamunda, Wakanda, Connecticut...
I don't know where you from.

574
00:30:01.258 --> 00:30:02.593
- Exactly.
- But I've been a force

575
00:30:02.676 --> 00:30:04.261
in this boy's life
since he was born.

576
00:30:04.345 --> 00:30:05.971
Please.

577
00:30:06.055 --> 00:30:07.598
It is the boy's birthright.

578
00:30:07.681 --> 00:30:09.350
I'm only giving him
an opportunity

579
00:30:09.433 --> 00:30:10.935
to have a better life.

580
00:30:11.018 --> 00:30:12.770
No. Hey, man, for real, look.

581
00:30:12.853 --> 00:30:14.396
I don't know
who you think you are,

582
00:30:14.480 --> 00:30:16.023
but I'm-a tell you
who I am, man.

583
00:30:16.106 --> 00:30:17.775
I'm Lavelle Junson, a'ight?

584
00:30:17.858 --> 00:30:19.568
And I don't need no handout.

585
00:30:22.029 --> 00:30:23.155
Hmm? Wait a minute.

586
00:30:23.239 --> 00:30:24.490
- Wait.
- My mistake.

587
00:30:24.573 --> 00:30:26.242
Continue.

588
00:30:26.325 --> 00:30:27.535
Oh, my God.

589
00:30:29.286 --> 00:30:31.121
Do the right thing.
Go ahead, boy.

590
00:30:34.333 --> 00:30:35.709
Ooh.

591
00:30:36.752 --> 00:30:39.213
Are those coins?
Are those gold bars?

592
00:30:39.296 --> 00:30:41.590
There's cash.

593
00:30:41.674 --> 00:30:43.801
Hey, yo, uh,

594
00:30:43.884 --> 00:30:45.844
you know, I'm thinking, who am I

595
00:30:45.928 --> 00:30:48.222
to say no to becoming a prince?

596
00:30:49.640 --> 00:30:51.850
Ma, pack your bags, man. We out.

597
00:30:51.934 --> 00:30:55.271
Amen! Okay, so do I get my own
hut with my private shaman?

598
00:30:55.354 --> 00:30:59.525
We are only offering to take
Lavelle back to Zamunda.

599
00:30:59.608 --> 00:31:01.169
Uh-uh.
Ain't happening like that, man.

600
00:31:01.193 --> 00:31:02.695
I'm not hopping on some plane,

601
00:31:02.778 --> 00:31:05.072
flying across the world
without my mother.

602
00:31:05.155 --> 00:31:07.157
All right? She coming.

603
00:31:10.494 --> 00:31:12.454
- So be it.
- So be it.

604
00:31:12.538 --> 00:31:14.182
- So be it.
- And so it is. A'ight.

605
00:31:14.206 --> 00:31:16.375
- I'm-a go pack.
- Okay, baby.

606
00:31:16.458 --> 00:31:18.002
Hey, Mary, you just gonna leave?

607
00:31:18.085 --> 00:31:20.045
Y'all know my PlayStation
ain't going nowhere.

608
00:31:20.129 --> 00:31:21.547
I mean, what about
all your stuff?

609
00:31:21.630 --> 00:31:24.049
It all sucks! Y'all can have it.

610
00:31:25.593 --> 00:31:28.762
Inform General Izzi that I have
retrieved my son from America.

611
00:31:28.846 --> 00:31:30.973
Yes, Your Majesty.

612
00:31:31.056 --> 00:31:33.017
Hey, we packed.

613
00:31:33.100 --> 00:31:34.810
Ah.

614
00:31:34.893 --> 00:31:37.313
Yes, the limousine is waiting
for you right downstairs.

615
00:31:37.396 --> 00:31:39.276
- Limo? We got a limo, man.
- What's that? Limo!

616
00:31:39.315 --> 00:31:41.233
I ain't been
in a limo since '00.

617
00:31:41.317 --> 00:31:43.169
- Hey. What's up?
- What's up, fellas?

618
00:31:43.193 --> 00:31:45.571
How y'all doing? Y'all so cute.

619
00:31:45.654 --> 00:31:48.324
Do you think Lisa
will be understanding?

620
00:31:48.407 --> 00:31:50.701
What is not to understand?

621
00:31:50.784 --> 00:31:51.994
You lied to me!

622
00:31:52.077 --> 00:31:53.621
I did not exactly lie to you.

623
00:31:53.704 --> 00:31:54.830
This reeks of Semmi.

624
00:31:54.913 --> 00:31:57.541
Ah, well, I don't want
to shift blame,

625
00:31:57.625 --> 00:31:59.335
but, yeah, it...
yes, you're right

626
00:31:59.418 --> 00:32:01.754
when you assume that Semmi had
something to do with this.

627
00:32:01.837 --> 00:32:03.339
I should've known about this.

628
00:32:05.382 --> 00:32:07.468
I did not know what to do.

629
00:32:07.551 --> 00:32:09.031
I was only trying to do
what is right.

630
00:32:09.094 --> 00:32:11.930
For our family or for Zamunda?

631
00:32:13.599 --> 00:32:15.059
Okay.

632
00:32:15.142 --> 00:32:17.519
You have an illegitimate son.

633
00:32:17.603 --> 00:32:19.164
You wouldn't be
the first king to have one.

634
00:32:19.188 --> 00:32:20.230
That is true.

635
00:32:20.314 --> 00:32:22.107
Besides, we hadn't even met yet.

636
00:32:22.191 --> 00:32:24.735
Exactly. We hadn't met yet.
It's not like I cheated on you.

637
00:32:24.818 --> 00:32:26.695
This happened
before we even met.

638
00:32:26.779 --> 00:32:28.965
And it's not like you're the
first man I've ever been with.

639
00:32:28.989 --> 00:32:30.175
Right, I...
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

640
00:32:30.199 --> 00:32:31.867
What did you just say
about the other men?

641
00:32:31.950 --> 00:32:33.494
So I guess, uh,

642
00:32:33.577 --> 00:32:35.337
you didn't really do
anything wrong, did you?

643
00:32:35.412 --> 00:32:38.040
It was a totally honest mistake
that can happen to anyone

644
00:32:38.123 --> 00:32:40.060
whose best friend introduced him
to a strange woman

645
00:32:40.084 --> 00:32:42.419
who drugged him
and had sex with him.

646
00:32:42.503 --> 00:32:44.046
But what did you say...
the other men

647
00:32:44.129 --> 00:32:45.422
that you were with, the...

648
00:32:49.343 --> 00:32:51.428
From here on out,

649
00:32:51.512 --> 00:32:53.889
I'm gonna need you
to be honest with me.

650
00:32:53.972 --> 00:32:56.642
- No more surprises.
- I promise.

651
00:32:56.725 --> 00:32:58.936
No more surprises, my sweet.

652
00:32:59.019 --> 00:33:01.438
Never again shall there be
another surprise.

653
00:33:01.522 --> 00:33:04.400
Ooh, ooh! What?!

654
00:33:04.483 --> 00:33:06.068
Look at this foyer!

655
00:33:06.151 --> 00:33:08.320
I got to get
some shots for the Gram.

656
00:33:08.404 --> 00:33:10.447
Goddamn!

657
00:33:10.531 --> 00:33:11.925
- Oh, my goodness!
- Hashtag "family"!

658
00:33:11.949 --> 00:33:13.492
That's the last surprise.

659
00:33:13.575 --> 00:33:15.285
- Hey! What's up, y'all?
- Hey!

660
00:33:15.369 --> 00:33:17.246
What's up, fam?

661
00:33:17.329 --> 00:33:19.164
Look, I'm gonna hug you
'cause I'm a hugger.

662
00:33:19.248 --> 00:33:20.708
Hey, Queen!

663
00:33:20.791 --> 00:33:23.585
I'm sorry I slept with your man.

664
00:33:23.669 --> 00:33:26.046
It's okay. It's okay.

665
00:33:26.130 --> 00:33:28.716
- What is going on here?
- Oh, children.

666
00:33:28.799 --> 00:33:31.969
Children, I would love for you
to meet your brother.

667
00:33:32.052 --> 00:33:35.139
Uh, Lavelle, uh,
Princess Tinashe.

668
00:33:35.222 --> 00:33:37.850
Tinashe, this is your
bastard brother from America.

669
00:33:37.933 --> 00:33:39.268
And, Princess Omma,

670
00:33:39.351 --> 00:33:42.604
this is your
bastard brother from America.

671
00:33:42.688 --> 00:33:45.607
Now, this is my eldest daughter,
Princess Meeka.

672
00:33:45.691 --> 00:33:47.025
Meeka, this is your bast...

673
00:33:47.109 --> 00:33:49.027
Bastard brother. They know.

674
00:33:49.111 --> 00:33:51.989
I think they get the idea.
So, how you doing?

675
00:33:52.072 --> 00:33:54.032
And my name is Mary.
How you doing?

676
00:33:54.116 --> 00:33:55.993
Just call me your second mom.

677
00:33:56.076 --> 00:33:58.579
But you really
don't have to, girls.

678
00:33:58.662 --> 00:34:01.582
I mean, but you should, though,
'cause I kind of am.

679
00:34:01.665 --> 00:34:03.041
Well, look at us.

680
00:34:03.125 --> 00:34:05.502
Just one big, happy

681
00:34:05.586 --> 00:34:08.255
Zamundan-American
aristocratic blended family.

682
00:34:08.338 --> 00:34:11.675
Ah, just like the Kardashians!

683
00:34:29.151 --> 00:34:31.904
And that is the story
of the bunny and the bear.

684
00:34:31.987 --> 00:34:33.947
Good class today, children.

685
00:34:34.031 --> 00:34:35.616
Okay, go play now.

686
00:34:35.699 --> 00:34:37.576
Play with your grenades
and your Kalashnikov.

687
00:34:37.659 --> 00:34:39.620
Sifo, don't mess with the sarin.

688
00:34:39.703 --> 00:34:41.371
Okay? It is dangerous.

689
00:34:41.455 --> 00:34:44.625
General Izzi,
we have just been informed

690
00:34:44.708 --> 00:34:49.588
King Akeem has returned
from America with a son.

691
00:34:49.671 --> 00:34:51.590
A son?

692
00:34:53.592 --> 00:34:55.761
A son.

693
00:35:10.567 --> 00:35:12.110
I am so hungry,

694
00:35:12.194 --> 00:35:14.112
I could eat the ass
out of a zebra.

695
00:35:17.282 --> 00:35:21.036
So, Lavelle,
what did you do in Queens

696
00:35:21.119 --> 00:35:23.497
before you found out
you were a prince?

697
00:35:23.580 --> 00:35:25.874
Oh, I wasn't doing that much,
you know what I mean?

698
00:35:25.958 --> 00:35:28.710
Just sort of, like,
in between opportunities.

699
00:35:28.794 --> 00:35:30.647
- You know?
- Let me tell you something, baby.

700
00:35:30.671 --> 00:35:33.006
- Hmm?
- You a prince now. Okay?

701
00:35:33.090 --> 00:35:35.926
And one day,
all this is gonna be yours.

702
00:35:36.009 --> 00:35:37.845
This long-ass table,
all this food,

703
00:35:37.928 --> 00:35:40.097
this whole damn kingdom.

704
00:35:40.180 --> 00:35:43.308
I always thought that Meeka
was going to be queen.

705
00:35:43.392 --> 00:35:45.227
A woman isn't
allowed to rule Zamunda.

706
00:35:45.310 --> 00:35:46.311
It's the law.

707
00:35:46.395 --> 00:35:49.606
So it's going to be this guy?

708
00:35:53.277 --> 00:35:55.529
I have lost my appetite.

709
00:35:55.612 --> 00:35:56.822
Mm.

710
00:36:00.784 --> 00:36:02.327
Mm.

711
00:36:02.411 --> 00:36:05.122
So, um, is anybody gonna tell me

712
00:36:05.205 --> 00:36:07.499
why these mashed potatoes
is black?

713
00:36:07.583 --> 00:36:09.042
It's caviar.

714
00:36:09.126 --> 00:36:11.336
- It's cava-what?
- Caviar, Mom.

715
00:36:11.420 --> 00:36:13.422
You know, our cousin named that.

716
00:36:19.469 --> 00:36:21.138
You sure you're
in the right room?

717
00:36:21.221 --> 00:36:24.600
Mm, Lisa, please.
I'm getting it from everywhere.

718
00:36:24.683 --> 00:36:26.602
Meeka is so upset.

719
00:36:30.606 --> 00:36:32.774
Did it ever occur to you
that maybe

720
00:36:32.858 --> 00:36:35.152
Meeka might have wanted
to be your heir?

721
00:36:35.235 --> 00:36:38.447
She's practically trained for it
her whole life.

722
00:36:40.198 --> 00:36:42.409
This boy would not have been
my first choice,

723
00:36:42.492 --> 00:36:44.870
but what can I do?

724
00:36:44.953 --> 00:36:48.123
He is my firstborn, my only son,

725
00:36:48.206 --> 00:36:50.125
and you know the law.

726
00:36:50.208 --> 00:36:51.835
That is not you talking.

727
00:36:51.919 --> 00:36:54.588
That is your father.

728
00:36:54.671 --> 00:36:56.298
Good night.

729
00:37:03.096 --> 00:37:05.641
Uh, Lisa, I was, uh, wondering,

730
00:37:05.724 --> 00:37:07.893
uh, I just recently returned
from a trip

731
00:37:07.976 --> 00:37:11.480
that was most tiresome,
and I thought maybe, perhaps,

732
00:37:11.563 --> 00:37:14.066
if you were in the mood...

733
00:37:14.149 --> 00:37:16.443
Yeah, perhaps it was
poor timing on my behalf

734
00:37:16.526 --> 00:37:18.987
to even suggest such a thing.

735
00:37:19.071 --> 00:37:21.448
Good night, my sweet.

736
00:37:21.531 --> 00:37:24.034
Uh, s-sweet dreams, my sweet.

737
00:37:30.415 --> 00:37:32.584
This is bullshit.

738
00:37:41.009 --> 00:37:42.552
Mm.

739
00:37:42.636 --> 00:37:44.262

00:38:45.115 --> 00:38:46.783
Okay, baby, first of all,
calm down.

768
00:38:46.867 --> 00:38:48.577
Okay?
You know we in another country.

Good morning,
Your Royal Highness.

788
00:39:32.412 --> 00:39:33.705
My name is Mirembe.

789
00:39:33.789 --> 00:39:35.832
I will be your royal groomer.

790
00:39:35.916 --> 00:39:37.959
Please allow me the honor

791
00:39:38.043 --> 00:39:40.587
of trimming
your most precious hairs.

792
00:39:40.670 --> 00:39:42.839
Um...

793
00:39:42.923 --> 00:39:45.592
The ones atop your head, sir.

794
00:39:45.675 --> 00:39:47.844
- Precious head of hair. Okay. All right.
- Yes.

795
00:39:47.928 --> 00:39:50.847
Surely, the royal bathers
have cleansed you thoroughly,

796
00:39:50.931 --> 00:39:53.558
judging by the smile
on your face.

797
00:39:56.812 --> 00:40:00.023
Now, please sit back and relax.

798
00:40:10.075 --> 00:40:13.078
Oh!

799
00:40:13.161 --> 00:40:15.080
Yo! Man, look at you.

800
00:40:15.163 --> 00:40:16.998
- You look beautiful.
- Thank you.

801
00:40:17.082 --> 00:40:19.334
- And you look so fre...
- Right? Right?

802
00:40:19.417 --> 00:40:20.836
- Right?
- What's this? What's this?

803
00:40:20.919 --> 00:40:23.171
Oh, yeah, I got a royal barber,
and she hooked me up.

804
00:40:25.549 --> 00:40:27.759
- We got to go.
- Right. Got that thing.

805
00:40:39.813 --> 00:40:44.442
Presenting Lavelle Junson
of Queens!

806
00:40:45.694 --> 00:40:47.237
And my moms.

807
00:40:47.320 --> 00:40:50.532
And his moms.

808
00:40:52.534 --> 00:40:55.662
Oh, hey, baby's daddy king.

809
00:40:55.745 --> 00:40:57.581
Step-mama queen, what up?

810
00:40:57.664 --> 00:41:00.250
Mother, don't you have
a dress like that?

811
00:41:00.333 --> 00:41:02.002
Thank you for the borrow.

812
00:41:02.085 --> 00:41:03.211
The royal tailors had to add

813
00:41:03.295 --> 00:41:04.671
some extra material
to make it fit.

814
00:41:04.754 --> 00:41:06.506
You got a dope closet, baby.

815
00:41:06.590 --> 00:41:08.508
And who told you
you could go through my closet?

816
00:41:08.592 --> 00:41:11.303
Well, well, I was just thinking,
since we're related,

817
00:41:11.386 --> 00:41:15.015
uh, maybe that we could share
a couple of...

818
00:41:15.098 --> 00:41:16.683
Why your mama so uppity?

819
00:41:16.766 --> 00:41:18.560
What is "uppity"?

820
00:41:18.643 --> 00:41:20.103
I am not uppity.

821
00:41:20.187 --> 00:41:21.897
Uppity bitch say what?

822
00:41:21.980 --> 00:41:23.523
What?

823
00:41:23.607 --> 00:41:24.900
You said it.

824
00:41:27.068 --> 00:41:28.904
We do that in Queens.

825
00:41:28.987 --> 00:41:31.323
I cannot stress how important
it is that you're here

826
00:41:31.406 --> 00:41:32.908
right now at this moment.

827
00:41:32.991 --> 00:41:34.492
For educational purposes.

828
00:41:34.576 --> 00:41:36.286
At any moment,
a world leader can come

829
00:41:36.369 --> 00:41:38.914
bursting through the door
with some pressing,

830
00:41:38.997 --> 00:41:42.375
uh, time-sensitive propositions.

831
00:42:00.977 --> 00:42:04.731
General Izzi, what a totally
unexpected surprise.

832
00:42:04.814 --> 00:42:08.610
King Akeem, I have come
to give you congratulations

833
00:42:08.693 --> 00:42:11.238
for locating
one of your lost sperm.

834
00:42:11.321 --> 00:42:14.699
I too wonder about
my own stray bullets.

835
00:42:14.783 --> 00:42:16.993
Thank you for your kind words.

836
00:42:17.077 --> 00:42:20.205
Ah, but I've not come
with just words.

837
00:42:20.288 --> 00:42:25.043
I came with a gift
for your new prince.

838
00:42:29.631 --> 00:42:34.010
With your permission,
King Akeem.

839
00:42:34.094 --> 00:42:35.845
My permission is granted.

840
00:42:58.868 --> 00:43:00.662
I would like to

841
00:43:00.745 --> 00:43:04.457

my daughter, Bopoto!

What's up?

879
00:44:55.443 --> 00:44:59.114
King Akeem, shall we join
our families in marriage

880
00:44:59.197 --> 00:45:00.907
under one flag

881
00:45:00.990 --> 00:45:05.453
by uniting your bastard
with my Bopoto?

882
00:45:08.748 --> 00:45:10.667
General...

883
00:45:10.750 --> 00:45:13.169
as you know, I have
very, very strong opinions

884
00:45:13.253 --> 00:45:15.463
when it comes
to arranged marriages.

885
00:45:15.547 --> 00:45:19.467
True love is the bedrock
of my kingdom.

886
00:45:24.097 --> 00:45:26.474
But if this is something
that Lavelle desires,

887
00:45:26.558 --> 00:45:28.226
who am I to stand in his way?

888
00:45:28.309 --> 00:45:29.602
- Wait, what?
- Father.

889
00:45:30.645 --> 00:45:33.523
Lavelle, is this what you want?

890
00:45:33.606 --> 00:45:36.067
Yeah. I'm 'bout it.

891
00:45:36.151 --> 00:45:37.735
Then it is settled!

892
00:45:37.819 --> 00:45:39.404
Then let us proceed!

893
00:45:39.487 --> 00:45:42.323
A semiautomatic shotgun wedding
it will be!

894
00:45:49.497 --> 00:45:53.334
Remember your father's
final words.

895
00:45:53.418 --> 00:45:56.754
The boy must pass
the princely test.

896
00:45:56.838 --> 00:46:00.800
To forget the princely test
would be to spit in the faces

897
00:46:00.884 --> 00:46:04.137
of the great Joffers
who have come before you.

898
00:46:05.138 --> 00:46:06.764
Whose auntie is this?

899
00:46:08.224 --> 00:46:09.767
I give you a week.

900
00:46:11.603 --> 00:46:14.564
I wouldn't want to go back
to plotting your death.

901
00:46:16.149 --> 00:46:17.233
Zoot!

902
00:46:17.317 --> 00:46:18.544
- Zoot!
- What's "zoot"?

903
00:46:18.568 --> 00:46:20.069
Y'all leaving?
Does that mean "leave"?

904
00:46:26.910 --> 00:46:29.370
I'll see you in one week,
my prince.

905
00:46:29.454 --> 00:46:31.080
A'ight.

906
00:46:32.874 --> 00:46:36.336
- Father, can we talk about this?
- There is nothing to talk about.

907
00:46:36.419 --> 00:46:38.838
Nexdoria is our greatest threat.

908
00:46:38.922 --> 00:46:41.758
To broker a peace hinging on
the testosterone-clouded whims

909
00:46:41.841 --> 00:46:44.469
of a son you barely even know
is foolish.

910
00:46:44.552 --> 00:46:46.513
I said there is
nothing to talk about.

911
00:46:55.104 --> 00:46:57.148
This is ZNN.

912
00:46:57.232 --> 00:46:58.775
Good evening, my neighbors.

913
00:46:58.858 --> 00:47:00.735
I'm Totatsi Bibinyana.

914
00:47:00.818 --> 00:47:03.029
In a most promising twist,

915
00:47:03.112 --> 00:47:05.865
the Zamunda News Network
has confirmed

916
00:47:05.949 --> 00:47:08.785
that King Akeem has a son.

917
00:47:08.868 --> 00:47:10.411
While it is too early
to determine

918
00:47:10.495 --> 00:47:12.664
whether the boy possesses
any strength, intelligence

919
00:47:12.747 --> 00:47:14.415
or capability whatsoever,

920
00:47:14.499 --> 00:47:17.210
what we do know
is that he is a man.

921
00:47:17.293 --> 00:47:19.963
And as far as Zamundan royalty
is concerned,

922
00:47:20.046 --> 00:47:21.548
that's good enough.

923
00:47:23.383 --> 00:47:24.652
The princely test
has three parts.

924
00:47:24.676 --> 00:47:26.135
- Okay. Uh-huh.
- Culture,

925
00:47:26.219 --> 00:47:29.722
critical thinking and,
more importantly, courage.

926
00:47:29.806 --> 00:47:31.266
Where do we begin?

927
00:47:31.349 --> 00:47:35.603
Teach the young prince
how to walk like royalty.

928
00:47:35.687 --> 00:47:37.313
That is what we will do.

929
00:47:37.397 --> 00:47:40.024
We will teach you
how to walk like a prince.

930
00:47:40.108 --> 00:47:41.859
Yo, what's wrong
with the way I walk now?

931
00:47:41.943 --> 00:47:43.695
You walk like an American pimp.

932
00:47:43.778 --> 00:47:45.863
You dress like
a slave from the future.

933
00:47:45.947 --> 00:47:47.532
Old Jar Jar Binks lookin' ass.

934
00:47:47.615 --> 00:47:49.742
Here, in this hall,

935
00:47:49.826 --> 00:47:54.163
you will come face-to-face
with your Zamundan heritage.

936
00:47:54.247 --> 00:47:56.207
Let us begin.

937
00:47:57.208 --> 00:47:58.418
Jompu Joffer.

938
00:47:58.501 --> 00:47:59.794
Jampu...

939
00:47:59.877 --> 00:48:02.297
- Jakoof Joffer.
- Jujkoof...

940
00:48:02.380 --> 00:48:04.340
Mighty Jokeim Joffer,

941
00:48:04.424 --> 00:48:06.509
the most handsome
of all the Joffers.

942
00:48:08.303 --> 00:48:09.721
Clench your backside.

943
00:48:09.804 --> 00:48:12.181
- Put your shoulders back.
- Mm-hmm.

944
00:48:12.265 --> 00:48:13.391
- Put your chin up.
- Mm-hmm.

945
00:48:13.474 --> 00:48:16.060
Suck in your stomach
and walk thusly.

946
00:48:17.103 --> 00:48:18.896
Now? Walk? Okay.

947
00:48:20.023 --> 00:48:22.609
- This is a regal gait.
- Okay.

948
00:48:24.193 --> 00:48:25.653
Stop! Don't...

949
00:48:25.737 --> 00:48:27.447
Tuck in your backside.

950
00:48:27.530 --> 00:48:29.115
And who is this?

951
00:48:29.198 --> 00:48:30.366
Uh, that's Jappa Joffer.

952
00:48:30.450 --> 00:48:32.243
- No.
- Jabba the Hutt Joffer.

953
00:48:32.327 --> 00:48:34.579
- No.
- Jumpin' Jack Flash Joffer.

954
00:48:34.662 --> 00:48:35.705
No.

955
00:48:35.788 --> 00:48:37.349
- Gerald Levert Joffer?
- No.

956
00:48:37.373 --> 00:48:39.125
- Jimmie "JJ" Walker Joffer?
- No.

957
00:48:39.208 --> 00:48:41.085
- Jabberwocky Joffer.
- No.

958
00:48:41.169 --> 00:48:42.229
James Brown Joffer.

959
00:48:42.253 --> 00:48:43.379
Hey!

960
00:48:50.762 --> 00:48:53.056
All right, y'all,
what am I doing out here?

961
00:48:53.139 --> 00:48:54.474
I'm hungry. I'm...

962
00:48:54.557 --> 00:48:57.226
I-I'm late for my bath.
What am I looking for?

963
00:48:57.310 --> 00:48:58.978
Hmm?

964
00:48:59.062 --> 00:49:01.272
Oh! That's a damn lion, bruh!

965
00:49:01.356 --> 00:49:04.692
Only when you can retrieve
the whiskers from a resting lion

966
00:49:04.776 --> 00:49:06.527
will you be ready
to become prince.

967
00:49:11.240 --> 00:49:12.450
This is a joke.

968
00:49:12.533 --> 00:49:14.243
This is a joke, 'cause I know

969
00:49:14.327 --> 00:49:16.167
your soft ass ain't never
do nothing like that.

970
00:49:16.204 --> 00:49:17.872
Oh, yes, I did.

971
00:49:17.955 --> 00:49:20.833
- On my very first attempt.
- Well...

972
00:49:20.917 --> 00:49:23.836
Yes. First attempt. Very brave.

973
00:49:23.920 --> 00:49:26.106
You will need the courage
of all your ancestors...

974
00:49:26.130 --> 00:49:28.174
A machete? A rocket launcher?
What you got?

975
00:49:28.257 --> 00:49:30.635
...and the cunningness
of your Western ways.

976
00:49:30.718 --> 00:49:33.096
And these.

977
00:49:39.936 --> 00:49:41.729
Thank you.

978
00:49:51.406 --> 00:49:53.282
Ain't this a bitch.

979
00:49:55.785 --> 00:49:57.203
I just don't belong here.

980
00:49:57.286 --> 00:49:59.831
You are the son
of the king of Zamunda.

981
00:50:01.708 --> 00:50:03.584
You come from a long line
of Joffers, and...

982
00:50:03.668 --> 00:50:06.671
I come from a long line
of broke-ass nobodies.

983
00:50:08.131 --> 00:50:11.300
What the hell I was thinking
that I could have this?

984
00:50:11.384 --> 00:50:13.386
Or any of it?

985
00:50:14.595 --> 00:50:17.014
Hey, for real, just...
cut this off, all right?

986
00:50:17.098 --> 00:50:18.725
Just cut it off.

987
00:50:20.435 --> 00:50:23.146
You want to get rid of
the royal princely braid?

988
00:50:24.397 --> 00:50:26.858
Well, this is fair.

989
00:50:26.941 --> 00:50:30.361
To be honest, it wasn't
a great look on you.

990
00:50:31.696 --> 00:50:34.782
Just one of the many
backward Zamundan traditions.

991
00:50:36.284 --> 00:50:38.077
Hell yeah.

992
00:50:38.161 --> 00:50:40.705
How long have you felt that way?
You know how itchy this is?

993
00:50:40.788 --> 00:50:42.749
It's a rat tail.

994
00:50:42.832 --> 00:50:45.293
And what's up
with y'all and lion whiskers?

995
00:50:45.376 --> 00:50:47.128
Like, be for real...
what's up with that?

996
00:50:48.921 --> 00:50:51.674
Hey, yo, I-I can't do this
right now, man.

997
00:50:54.469 --> 00:50:56.471
Yo, look where I'm at.

998
00:50:58.181 --> 00:51:00.224
I'm not supposed to be here.

999
00:51:01.267 --> 00:51:03.102
You know, my whole life,
I had dreams

1000
00:51:03.186 --> 00:51:05.021
that my pops
would show up and take

1001
00:51:05.104 --> 00:51:07.231
me and my mom away
to a whole new life.

1002
00:51:07.315 --> 00:51:09.233
And come to find out,
he's a king.

1003
00:51:09.317 --> 00:51:11.027
To a whole damn country.

1004
00:51:11.110 --> 00:51:13.154
And the only way
to meet his expectations

1005
00:51:13.237 --> 00:51:16.866
is to walk with a stick
up my ass or get myself killed.

1006
00:51:18.993 --> 00:51:20.953
This-this ain't my way, Mirembe.

1007
00:51:21.037 --> 00:51:24.624
And I-I-I can't... I can't be
what he wants me to be.

1008
00:51:26.334 --> 00:51:30.087
Then perhaps
be not as King Akeem

1009
00:51:30.171 --> 00:51:32.423
but as Prince Akeem.

1010
00:51:34.091 --> 00:51:35.927
Ain't that the same brother?

1011
00:51:37.094 --> 00:51:38.846
You haven't heard the story.

1012
00:51:38.930 --> 00:51:41.390
Everyone in Zamunda knows

1013
00:51:41.474 --> 00:51:45.228
the legend of Prince Akeem

1014
00:51:45.311 --> 00:51:48.815
in the land of Queens.

1015
00:51:48.898 --> 00:51:51.442
Prince Akeem was
a dutiful prince

1016
00:51:51.526 --> 00:51:53.152
and loyal son of Zamunda.

1017
00:51:53.236 --> 00:51:54.278
Hello, Babar.

1018
00:51:54.362 --> 00:51:55.863
But he believed that a man

1019
00:51:55.947 --> 00:51:57.907
must walk his own path
and follow his heart.

1020
00:51:57.990 --> 00:51:59.742
I intend to find my bride.

1021
00:51:59.826 --> 00:52:01.577
What is wrong
with the one you have now?

1022
00:52:01.661 --> 00:52:03.496
Bark like a dog.

1023
00:52:03.579 --> 00:52:05.164
I want a woman that's going to

1024
00:52:05.248 --> 00:52:07.041
arouse my intellect
as well as my loins.

1025
00:52:07.124 --> 00:52:09.085
He flew across the sea

1026
00:52:09.168 --> 00:52:10.586
to find his true love.

1027
00:52:10.670 --> 00:52:11.838
Now there,

1028
00:52:11.921 --> 00:52:14.924
in the barbaric land of Queens

1029
00:52:15.007 --> 00:52:18.344
did Prince Akeem battle
bug-eyed burglars,

1030
00:52:18.427 --> 00:52:20.221
foul-mouthed barbers

1031
00:52:20.304 --> 00:52:23.099
and sexist men of the cloth

1032
00:52:23.182 --> 00:52:25.476
to win the heart
of his true love,

1033
00:52:25.560 --> 00:52:28.271

and beautiful and magical.

1039
00:52:42.660 --> 00:52:45.454
A new dawn had arised

1040

a new sense of hope

1041

may have forgotten his story,

1044

but the people of Zamunda
have not.

Walk your own path.

Be not the prince of Zamunda.

I present to you Kareem Junson,

1057
00:53:48.726 --> 00:53:52.313
aka Uncle Reem,

1058
00:53:52.396 --> 00:53:54.357
my royal consigliere.

1059
00:53:54.440 --> 00:53:56.525
That's Italian
for "mack daddy mentor."

1060
00:53:56.609 --> 00:53:59.779
You need no other teacher
than your king and your father.

1061
00:53:59.862 --> 00:54:02.198
No, no, no, no. See, you watch
your bottom lip, money grip,

1062
00:54:02.281 --> 00:54:03.884
'cause you understand,
while y'all was out here

1063
00:54:03.908 --> 00:54:05.618
riding elephants
and chasing Tarzan,

1064
00:54:05.701 --> 00:54:08.913
I was schooling this boy
on the streets of Queens.

1065
00:54:08.996 --> 00:54:10.933
- All right, well, that's...
- No, 'cause he don't know me.

1066
00:54:10.957 --> 00:54:13.250
- You do not know me.
- No, you don't know me.

1067
00:54:13.334 --> 00:54:14.377
You do not know me.

1068
00:54:14.460 --> 00:54:15.812
- You don't know me.
- I will cut you.

1069
00:54:15.836 --> 00:54:17.004
Enough of this.

1070
00:54:19.173 --> 00:54:23.469
Uncle Reem of Queens...
you're welcome in my kingdom.

1071
00:54:23.552 --> 00:54:24.804
Come on.

1072
00:54:24.887 --> 00:54:26.931
Benson, y'all got
some crab cakes, man?

1073
00:54:27.014 --> 00:54:28.057
I need some protein.

1074
00:54:28.140 --> 00:54:30.351
- Who is Benson?
- Benson is you.

1075
00:54:30.434 --> 00:54:32.228
Hold up. Hold up.

1076
00:54:32.311 --> 00:54:34.689
Let me get my Spotify
on deck real quick.

1077
00:54:36.482 --> 00:54:37.775
Let's rock.

1078
00:54:37.858 --> 00:54:39.735
You ain't said nothing
but a thing.

1079
00:54:39.819 --> 00:54:40.820
See his feet?

1080
00:54:40.903 --> 00:54:42.113
- Yes.
- See where his hand at?

1081
00:54:42.196 --> 00:54:43.864
- Mm-hmm.
- See how he moving?

1082
00:54:43.948 --> 00:54:46.617
Yes. There's a fluidity to it.

1083
00:54:46.701 --> 00:54:49.620
Yeah, it's like Bruce Lee said,
"Be like water."

1084
00:54:49.704 --> 00:54:51.330
That's Hebbe Joffer.

1085
00:54:51.414 --> 00:54:52.974
Legend has it
he could speak to animals,

1086
00:54:52.999 --> 00:54:54.239
and people thought he was crazy

1087
00:54:54.291 --> 00:54:56.091
until he made a giraffe
do the Electric Slide.

1088
00:54:57.253 --> 00:54:59.213
It appears a royal wedding

1089
00:54:59.296 --> 00:55:00.965
may soon be upon us.

1090
00:55:01.048 --> 00:55:02.842
For more on this,
we are joined by Semmi.

1091
00:55:02.925 --> 00:55:04.260
Good to see you, Totatsi.

1092
00:55:04.343 --> 00:55:07.763
According to our ZNN source
inside the palace,

1093
00:55:07.847 --> 00:55:09.765
we are hearing... and I quote...

1094
00:55:09.849 --> 00:55:13.769
"The boy been balling
on this princely-ass test

1095
00:55:13.853 --> 00:55:18.607
ever since his handsome
and mad smart uncle showed up."

1096
00:55:18.691 --> 00:55:21.152
That is absurd, Totatsi.
Who is your source?

1097
00:55:21.235 --> 00:55:23.112
What the deal? What the deal?

1098
00:55:23.195 --> 00:55:25.239
Palace life for me.

1099
00:55:25.322 --> 00:55:26.949
Who do you think you are, Reem,

1100
00:55:27.033 --> 00:55:28.492
going behind the king's back?

1101
00:55:28.576 --> 00:55:30.216
- You keep talking slick...
- G-Gentlemen.

1102
00:55:30.286 --> 00:55:32.038
...and when my man
is running this place,

1103
00:55:32.121 --> 00:55:33.873
you gonna go from
royal ass kisser

1104
00:55:33.956 --> 00:55:35.708
- to royal ass wiper.
- No, no.

1105
00:55:35.791 --> 00:55:37.561
- I will do no such thing.
- Please, g-gent...

1106
00:55:37.585 --> 00:55:39.503
Yeah, well,
I eat a lot of fried food,

1107
00:55:39.587 --> 00:55:40.880
so don't come at me with

1108
00:55:40.963 --> 00:55:42.715
- anything less than two-ply.
- Oh!

- Now let me hear you say, "Hey, ho."
- I don't know...

1118
00:56:04.070 --> 00:56:05.529
- Hey, ho.
- That's right.

1119
00:56:05.613 --> 00:56:07.531
That's how we do it
in Queens, though.

1120
00:56:07.615 --> 00:56:09.658
- Hey, ho.
- Oh, no, no, no, no.

1121
00:56:09.742 --> 00:56:11.094
No, don't do that.
That's his mother.

1122
00:56:11.118 --> 00:56:12.679
- Oh, don't say it to...
- No, not to his mother.

1123
00:56:12.703 --> 00:56:14.306
- You obese American, you.
- No.

1124
00:56:14.330 --> 00:56:15.706
Yeah, for 25 cents a day,

1125
00:56:15.790 --> 00:56:18.417
I could sponsor-feed
your scrawny ass.

1126
00:56:18.501 --> 00:56:20.336
Go to hell, you Western weasel!

1127
00:56:20.419 --> 00:56:22.213
- Yo, well, why don't you go?
- Make me.

1128
00:56:22.296 --> 00:56:23.964
You know something? Then I will.

1129
00:56:24.048 --> 00:56:25.591
You cholesterol dumpster fire,
you.

1130
00:56:25.674 --> 00:56:27.510
I... o-okay, okay.

1131
00:56:27.593 --> 00:56:28.987
Totatsi! Call the guards!

1132
00:56:29.011 --> 00:56:30.280
Let us, let us go
for a short break.

1133
00:56:30.304 --> 00:56:31.680
Hmm.

1134
00:56:31.764 --> 00:56:32.932
That's Forest Whitaker.

1135
00:56:33.015 --> 00:56:34.391
I'm joking. That's not...

1136
00:56:34.475 --> 00:56:36.560
That one is Tunde Joffer.

1137
00:56:36.644 --> 00:56:38.288
Uh, he's the reason why
the Zamundans migrated

1138
00:56:38.312 --> 00:56:39.438
from the north to the east.

1139
00:56:39.522 --> 00:56:41.023
He's doing pretty good.

1140
00:56:41.107 --> 00:56:43.609
Yeah?

1141
00:56:43.692 --> 00:56:45.754
♪ I'm a queen, I'm a queen,
I'm a queen, I'm a queen ♪

1142
00:56:45.778 --> 00:56:48.322
♪ Ain't nothing move

1143
00:56:48.405 --> 00:56:50.616

1144
00:56:50.699 --> 00:56:52.660
There is but one test
that remains:

1145
00:56:52.743 --> 00:56:54.495
retrieving the whiskers
from a lion.

1146
00:56:56.372 --> 00:56:59.917
How will you conquer your fear?

1147
00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:01.627
I'm not.

1148
00:57:01.710 --> 00:57:03.254
It's a damn lion.

1149
00:57:03.337 --> 00:57:05.256
Well, I found it is helpful
to think of them

1150
00:57:05.339 --> 00:57:07.007
as just being big house cats.

1151
00:57:07.091 --> 00:57:08.592
Oh?

1152
00:57:08.676 --> 00:57:10.052
Just big house cats?

1153
00:57:10.136 --> 00:57:12.304
Really?
When'd you figure that out?

1154
00:57:12.388 --> 00:57:14.723
Was that on your tenth
or 11th try?

1155
00:57:14.807 --> 00:57:16.433
I know not what you speak of.

1156
00:57:16.517 --> 00:57:18.144
I was successful my first time,

1157
00:57:18.227 --> 00:57:20.479
- just like my father.
- Jaffe Joffer.

1158
00:57:20.563 --> 00:57:22.982
- And his father before him.
- Jappa Joffer.

1159
00:57:24.024 --> 00:57:26.068
Very good. Very good!

1160
00:57:27.444 --> 00:57:29.488
Oh, watch.

1161
00:57:29.572 --> 00:57:31.031
- Oh, shit!
- Oh, do not be alarmed.

1162
00:57:31.115 --> 00:57:32.825
This Babar, he is my friend.

1163
00:57:32.908 --> 00:57:34.827
I have known him
since he was a small elephant.

1164
00:57:34.910 --> 00:57:35.953
Let him pass. Move.

1165
00:57:36.036 --> 00:57:37.305
- Let him pass.
- All right.

1166
00:57:37.329 --> 00:57:39.081
Come through, Babar, my friend.

1167
00:57:39.165 --> 00:57:41.458
Babar, the magnificent one.

1168
00:57:41.542 --> 00:57:44.003
I have known him
since he was a little elephant,

1169
00:57:44.086 --> 00:57:45.880
and now he is a father, as well.

1170
00:57:45.963 --> 00:57:47.506
- Wow.
- The great one!

1171
00:57:52.219 --> 00:57:54.847
I must admit,
your manner and your style

1172
00:57:54.930 --> 00:57:57.766
is foreign to my kingdom,
but it is impressive.

1173
00:57:57.850 --> 00:58:01.478
Yeah? Damn, I'm just
trying to be like you.

1174
00:58:01.562 --> 00:58:03.480
You know what I mean?

1175
00:58:03.564 --> 00:58:06.400
You know, Mirembe,
my royal barber,

1176
00:58:06.483 --> 00:58:08.777
told me the story that your pops

1177
00:58:08.861 --> 00:58:10.988
wanted you to marry
a Nexdorian girl,

1178
00:58:11.071 --> 00:58:14.200
so you bounced to Queens to find
a wife on your own terms.

1179
00:58:16.368 --> 00:58:18.621
I wanted to find
more than a wife.

1180
00:58:18.704 --> 00:58:22.249
To find someone that
I connected with on every level.

1181
00:58:22.333 --> 00:58:24.168
Someone who knew
where I was coming from

1182
00:58:24.251 --> 00:58:27.379
even though we came from
entirely two different places.

1183
00:58:31.967 --> 00:58:34.720
And one might say I was
looking for myself, as well.

1184
00:58:37.806 --> 00:58:40.893
Get some rest, my son.

1185
00:58:42.811 --> 00:58:44.396
Thanks, Pops.

1186
00:59:06.377 --> 00:59:08.295
He looks hungry.

1187
00:59:08.379 --> 00:59:10.881
You can see it in how
he walks low to the ground.

1188
00:59:10.965 --> 00:59:13.259
Look, man, you haven't liked me
since I got here,

1189
00:59:13.342 --> 00:59:15.219
and I get that,
but ain't my fault

1190
00:59:15.302 --> 00:59:18.013
your dad knocked up my mom and
dragged my ass back to Africa.

1191
00:59:18.097 --> 00:59:20.557
Well, no one is
asking you to stay.

1192
00:59:20.641 --> 00:59:22.476
It's all good, little sis.
All good.

1193
00:59:22.559 --> 00:59:24.412
I'll be gone in a minute,
'cause I'm about to be

1194
00:59:24.436 --> 00:59:25.729
- eaten by a lion!
- I hope so!

1195
00:59:25.813 --> 00:59:26.897
- Fine! Fine!
- Fine!

1196
00:59:34.071 --> 00:59:36.615
You really think
I'm gonna fail, don't you?

1197
00:59:43.539 --> 00:59:45.874
I have never said that...

1198
00:59:45.958 --> 00:59:47.876
out loud.

1199
00:59:47.960 --> 00:59:49.837
You ain't got to.

1200
00:59:49.920 --> 00:59:51.255
It's that look.

1201
00:59:55.467 --> 00:59:58.012
Been getting that look
my entire life.

1202
00:59:58.095 --> 01:00:01.265
People writing me off
'cause of the way I talk

1203
01:00:01.348 --> 01:00:03.726
or where I'm from.

1204
01:00:03.809 --> 01:00:05.811
But you got no idea
what I'm talking about.

1205
01:00:05.894 --> 01:00:08.105
'Cause you a princess.

1206
01:00:08.188 --> 01:00:11.859
Princesses can be written off
just as much as anyone.

1207
01:00:11.942 --> 01:00:15.070
I have been preparing
my whole life

1208
01:00:15.154 --> 01:00:17.865
to be standing where you are
in this moment.

1209
01:00:19.450 --> 01:00:20.993
But you are right.

1210
01:00:21.076 --> 01:00:22.911
It is not fair
for me to blame you

1211
01:00:22.995 --> 01:00:25.289
for my father's mistake.

1212
01:00:25.372 --> 01:00:27.833
Not that you are a mistake.

1213
01:00:27.916 --> 01:00:29.835
- Well, you kind of are a mistake.
- Okay.

1214
01:00:29.918 --> 01:00:31.879
I get it, I get it. A'ight.

1215
01:00:31.962 --> 01:00:33.505
Damn.

1216
01:00:40.220 --> 01:00:43.474
Perhaps the test has
nothing to do with bravery.

1217
01:00:45.559 --> 01:00:49.772
The tests are also a challenge
of the mind.

1218

So, in sales, it's called
a bait and switch.

1225
01:01:16.256 --> 01:01:18.336
So, the customer thinks
that they're buying something

1226
01:01:18.384 --> 01:01:20.177
at half off,
so they come flocking,

1227
01:01:20.260 --> 01:01:22.155
waving their wallets,
just hungry to buy something,

1228
01:01:22.179 --> 01:01:23.972
but by the time they get there,

1229
01:01:24.056 --> 01:01:26.100
you sell 'em the upgrade
at double the price.

1230
01:01:26.183 --> 01:01:28.852
Yes. It is the same
as a technique

1231
01:01:28.936 --> 01:01:31.522
we use in battle
called the feigned withdrawal.

1232
01:01:31.605 --> 01:01:34.108
An army retreats
with the sole intention

1233
01:01:34.191 --> 01:01:36.902
of drawing the enemy out
and ambushing him.

1234
01:01:36.985 --> 01:01:39.405
So, what, in this scenario,
I'm-I'm the retreating army?

1248
01:02:09.268 --> 01:02:11.812
My nephew could be eaten
by a man-eating lion!

1249
01:02:11.895 --> 01:02:13.814
Besides, what kind of kingdom
is this?

1250
01:02:13.897 --> 01:02:17.985
I don't see no Lunchables or
no lunch trays up here, nothing!

1251
01:02:55.606 --> 01:02:58.025
No.

1252
01:03:01.069 --> 01:03:02.154
Oh!

1253
01:03:05.073 --> 01:03:06.825
Run! Run!

1254
01:03:06.909 --> 01:03:08.869
Trust me, don't look back!

1255
01:03:08.952 --> 01:03:10.454
Just keep running!
Keep running! Run!

1256
01:03:10.537 --> 01:03:12.289
Keep running!

1257
01:03:28.222 --> 01:03:29.723
No, no. No!

1258
01:03:32.976 --> 01:03:35.145
He's trapped. I must save him.

1259
01:03:35.229 --> 01:03:36.271
Stupid.

1260
01:03:36.355 --> 01:03:37.356
Wait, Father.

1261
01:03:40.359 --> 01:03:42.236
Look.

1262
01:03:49.159 --> 01:03:51.370
What is this?

1263
01:03:52.871 --> 01:03:55.123
What is this?

1264
01:03:55.207 --> 01:03:57.918
What every dangerous
house cat likes.

1265
01:04:00.212 --> 01:04:01.421
Cat food.

1266
01:04:37.207 --> 01:04:39.501
I got 'em. Mm-hmm.

1267
01:04:44.089 --> 01:04:46.133
He is almost ready
to become a prince.

1268
01:04:46.216 --> 01:04:47.593
Wait, almost?

1269
01:04:49.303 --> 01:04:53.140
It is time for umbajuntoo.

1270
01:04:53.223 --> 01:04:55.892
- Umbajuntoo!
- Umbajuntoo!

1271
01:05:06.695 --> 01:05:09.406
Uh, what's-what's, uh...
umbajuntoo?

1272
01:05:09.489 --> 01:05:11.950
Ceremonial circumcision.

1273
01:05:12.034 --> 01:05:14.244
Ceremonial...

1274
01:05:14.328 --> 01:05:15.888
That mean they're gonna
sharpen your tool, nephew.

1275
01:05:15.912 --> 01:05:18.582
- Hold him.
- Hey, yo, ain't got to restrain me. Yo...

1276
01:05:18.665 --> 01:05:20.560
- Hey, Ma, tell 'em we already did this!
- That's okay, baby.

1277
01:05:20.584 --> 01:05:22.169
We love it here, right?

1278
01:05:22.252 --> 01:05:24.129
Let them take a little bit
off the top.

1279
01:05:24.212 --> 01:05:28.884
These are the foreskins
of your forefathers.

1280
01:05:28.967 --> 01:05:31.219
- Ew.
- Joffer Joffer.

1281
01:05:31.303 --> 01:05:33.138
Great-great-great-grandfather.

1282
01:05:33.221 --> 01:05:35.182
Jappa Joffer.

1283
01:05:35.265 --> 01:05:36.683
Your great-grandfather.

1284
01:05:36.767 --> 01:05:38.685
Jaffe Joffer.

1285
01:05:38.769 --> 01:05:39.770
Your grandfather.

1286
01:05:39.853 --> 01:05:43.357
And King Akeem.

1287
01:05:48.945 --> 01:05:50.781
Okay.

1288
01:06:09.508 --> 01:06:12.594
What are you...
Oh, what is wrong with you?

1289
01:06:14.596 --> 01:06:16.098
See, a potato.

1290
01:06:22.979 --> 01:06:26.233
They got you, baby!
They got you!

1291
01:06:27.609 --> 01:06:30.612
You just completed
the final princely test,

1292
01:06:30.696 --> 01:06:33.240
- the test of courage.
- Courage?

1293
01:06:33.323 --> 01:06:35.492
Need I remind you
I was face-to-face

1294
01:06:35.575 --> 01:06:36.827
with a man-eating lion?

1295
01:06:36.910 --> 01:06:39.162
For one to put
his member in danger

1296
01:06:39.246 --> 01:06:41.915
is also a test of courage, yes?

1297
01:06:41.998 --> 01:06:45.085
You are willing to sacrifice
what is most sacred.

1298
01:06:45.168 --> 01:06:46.753
My penis?

1299
01:06:46.837 --> 01:06:48.714
Your pride.

1300
01:06:50.006 --> 01:06:52.217
Lavelle Junson of Queens,

1301
01:06:52.300 --> 01:06:55.679
I hereby crown you

1302
01:06:55.762 --> 01:06:58.223
the prince of Zamunda.

1303
01:07:03.270 --> 01:07:05.814
Okay, so you thought
the best response was

1304
01:07:05.897 --> 01:07:07.607
to let them cut it off?

1305
01:07:07.691 --> 01:07:09.609
I was doing whatever it took.

1306
01:07:09.693 --> 01:07:11.445
Like what, exactly?

1307
01:07:11.528 --> 01:07:13.947
Well, to prove myself.

1308
01:07:14.030 --> 01:07:15.949
You know, like,
I-I never really got

1309
01:07:16.032 --> 01:07:17.576
the chance to do that back home.

1310
01:07:23.248 --> 01:07:25.333
As you were.

1311
01:07:27.210 --> 01:07:30.297
I take it you are growing
accustomed to a palace life.

1312
01:07:30.380 --> 01:07:32.132
I mean...

1313
01:07:32.215 --> 01:07:35.802
aside from some insane rituals
y'all have here,

1314
01:07:35.886 --> 01:07:38.889
I suppose life here
ain't too bad.

1315
01:07:43.560 --> 01:07:45.872
- Well, there are certain disadvantages.
- Uh-huh.

1316
01:07:45.896 --> 01:07:47.790
- I mean, have you seen a Zamundan movie?
- Mm-mm.

1317
01:07:47.814 --> 01:07:49.649
Total baboon dung.

1318
01:07:49.733 --> 01:07:52.778
So, what, like, nothing
over a 30% on Rotten Papayas?

1319
01:07:52.861 --> 01:07:54.279
Ah.

1320
01:07:54.362 --> 01:07:56.490
American cinema is the best.

1321
01:07:56.573 --> 01:07:58.492
The best? That is, like,

1322
01:07:58.575 --> 01:08:00.869
the most blasphemous thing
I've ever heard.

1323
01:08:00.952 --> 01:08:03.079
What do we have
besides superhero shit,

1324
01:08:03.163 --> 01:08:07.334
uh, remakes and-and sequels
to old movies nobody asked for?

1325
01:08:07.417 --> 01:08:09.211
This is true about sequels.

1326
01:08:09.294 --> 01:08:10.712
If something is good...

1327
01:08:10.796 --> 01:08:12.130
...why ruin it?

1328
01:08:12.214 --> 01:08:13.465
Mm.

1329
01:08:13.548 --> 01:08:15.884
- Although there are exceptions.
- Like what?

1330
01:08:15.967 --> 01:08:17.928
Are you familiar
with the Barbershop series?

1331
01:08:18.011 --> 01:08:19.805
- Am I familiar with...
- Look at me.

1332
01:08:19.888 --> 01:08:22.265
Of course I'm familiar
with the Barbershop series.

1333
01:08:22.349 --> 01:08:26.311
My favorite spin-off is
the one with Queen Latifah.

1334
01:08:26.394 --> 01:08:28.855
Yeah, but that's not Barbershop.

1335
01:08:28.939 --> 01:08:31.441
That's Beauty Shop.

1336
01:08:31.525 --> 01:08:34.277
To-mah-to, to-may-to.

1337
01:08:34.361 --> 01:08:36.363
Potato, papaya.

1338
01:08:40.283 --> 01:08:42.452
So, what,
American entertainment?

1339
01:08:42.536 --> 01:08:44.538
Is that our biggest difference?

1340
01:08:45.956 --> 01:08:47.749
Well...

1341
01:08:47.833 --> 01:08:51.503
there are certain freedoms
that exist outside of Zamunda.

1342
01:08:51.586 --> 01:08:53.255
Okay.

1343
01:08:53.338 --> 01:08:54.965
Like what?

1344
01:08:56.842 --> 01:08:59.427
Okay, this is
going to sound stupid,

1345
01:08:59.511 --> 01:09:02.556
but it has always been
a dream of mine to...

1346
01:09:02.639 --> 01:09:04.641
to one day have
my own barbershop.

1347
01:09:05.684 --> 01:09:06.768
Yo, that's awesome.

1348
01:09:08.103 --> 01:09:09.729
Are you making fun of me?

1349
01:09:09.813 --> 01:09:11.356
No.

1350
01:09:11.439 --> 01:09:13.191
Nah, I'm being dead-ass.

1351
01:09:13.275 --> 01:09:14.776
Do it.

1352
01:09:14.860 --> 01:09:16.987
I-I don't know anybody
who can work scissors like you.

1353
01:09:17.070 --> 01:09:19.281
Well, except
women are not allowed

1354
01:09:19.364 --> 01:09:20.991
to own businesses in Zamunda.

1355
01:09:21.074 --> 01:09:23.034
You serious?

1356
01:09:23.118 --> 01:09:24.536
Indeed.

1357
01:09:24.619 --> 01:09:26.580
That's not cool.

1358
01:09:28.206 --> 01:09:30.667
Well, I'm prince, right?

1359
01:09:30.750 --> 01:09:32.335
So, you know something?

1360
01:09:32.419 --> 01:09:34.504
As long as I'm prince,

1361
01:09:34.588 --> 01:09:37.299
I can promise you there's gonna
be some changes around here.

1362
01:09:37.382 --> 01:09:40.093
Well, that is very idealistic.

1363
01:09:40.176 --> 01:09:42.888
But every prince...

1364
01:09:42.971 --> 01:09:45.140
promises to do things
differently,

1365
01:09:45.223 --> 01:09:47.726
but eventually, they do things

1366
01:09:47.809 --> 01:09:49.811
the same way they've always
been done before.

1367
01:09:51.062 --> 01:09:54.065
Yeah, well, I'm not like
every other prince.

1368
01:09:54.149 --> 01:09:56.192
Remember?

1369
01:09:56.276 --> 01:09:58.153
I'm a prince from Queens.

1370
01:09:59.195 --> 01:10:02.032
I wonder who told you that.

1371
01:10:02.115 --> 01:10:04.492
Somebody.

1372
01:10:13.752 --> 01:10:16.338
I should not have done that.

1373
01:10:16.421 --> 01:10:18.548
- I should not have done that.
- Wait. Wait, hold on.

1374
01:10:18.632 --> 01:10:20.050
Mirem...

1375
01:10:20.133 --> 01:10:21.760
Um...

1376
01:10:23.261 --> 01:10:26.306
I think it is best you go to bed
and get some rest.

1377
01:10:27.390 --> 01:10:29.726
Tomorrow is going to be
a very long day.

1378
01:10:29.809 --> 01:10:32.604
You are one step closer to...

1379
01:10:32.687 --> 01:10:34.898
marrying your princess.

1380
01:10:38.693 --> 01:10:40.320
Good night.

1381
01:10:59.255 --> 01:11:02.926
Presenting the crown prince
of Zamunda,

1382
01:11:03.009 --> 01:11:04.928
Prince Lavelle!

1383
01:11:28.785 --> 01:11:30.495
- King Akeem.
- Yes.

1384
01:11:30.578 --> 01:11:32.163
So wonderful to see you,
General.

1385

Ooh.

1386

Hey, dig this here.

Could I get two Crown Royals

Compadre?

Well, if you're
going to wear that dress,

1414
01:12:56.247 --> 01:12:57.999

Yes, girl, me and you
'bout to turn it up.

your finest drink.

Two shots of chilled Cîroc.

1431
01:13:37.872 --> 01:13:41.292
So, uh... marriage.

1432
01:13:41.376 --> 01:13:42.919
It's a big step.

1433
01:13:43.962 --> 01:13:46.548
I will make you a happy prince.

1434
01:13:50.301 --> 01:13:51.845
What about you?

1435
01:13:51.928 --> 01:13:54.556
How can I make you
a happy princess?

1436
01:13:54.639 --> 01:13:56.432
What do you like?

1437
01:13:56.516 --> 01:13:59.519
Whatever you like.

1438
01:14:00.562 --> 01:14:02.230
Okay, I'll back up.

1439
01:14:02.313 --> 01:14:06.151
Uh, Bopoto,
what's your favorite movie?

1440
01:14:06.234 --> 01:14:09.737
Whatever is your favorite movie.

1441
01:14:09.821 --> 01:14:12.240
Uh... is there a goal you have?

1442
01:14:12.323 --> 01:14:14.701
Is-is there a business
that you want to start?

1443
01:14:14.784 --> 01:14:17.704
Whatever business
you'd like to start.

1444
01:14:27.088 --> 01:14:31.134
I want to have a connection
with the person

1445
01:14:31.217 --> 01:14:34.387
that I'm gonna spend
the rest of my life with.

1446
01:14:34.470 --> 01:14:36.973
But I am just a wife.

1447
01:14:43.897 --> 01:14:45.982
- Can you wait right here?
- Okay.

1448
01:14:46.065 --> 01:14:48.151
- But what shall I do?
- Just wait.

1449
01:14:48.234 --> 01:14:49.944
Right here.

1450
01:14:51.321 --> 01:14:53.072
I shall wait here.

1451
01:14:54.073 --> 01:14:55.783

01:15:18.848 --> 01:15:20.808
Hey, um, I don't mean
to interrupt,

1463
01:15:20.892 --> 01:15:23.770
but, Mutombo, do you mind
if I have a minute with her?

1464
01:15:23.853 --> 01:15:25.146
My bad, man.

1465
01:15:25.230 --> 01:15:27.065
No, no, no.

1466
01:15:27.148 --> 01:15:28.608
It's your party, Prince.

1467
01:15:28.691 --> 01:15:30.610
Come here, you gentle giant.

1468
01:15:30.693 --> 01:15:32.654
Yeah.

1469
01:15:32.737 --> 01:15:34.864
I need to talk to you.

1470
01:15:36.074 --> 01:15:37.951
There's nothing for us
to talk about.

1471
01:15:38.034 --> 01:15:39.285
Excuse me.

1472
01:15:39.369 --> 01:15:40.620
Yes, there is.

1473
01:15:40.703 --> 01:15:42.830
I don't want to marry her.

1474
01:15:50.213 --> 01:15:52.465
I want to be with you.

1475
01:15:54.092 --> 01:15:57.303
You and only you are
the reason why I'm a prince.

1476
01:15:57.387 --> 01:15:59.514
But, Lavelle...

1477
01:15:59.597 --> 01:16:00.974
Look.

1478
01:16:01.975 --> 01:16:03.851
My father...

1479
01:16:03.935 --> 01:16:05.520
he'll understand.

1480
01:16:07.522 --> 01:16:09.274
I'll be right back.

1481
01:16:13.403 --> 01:16:16.739
I must say, you are more like
your father than I thought.

1482
01:16:16.823 --> 01:16:19.033
Oh, really?
Why do you say that, General?

1483
01:16:19.117 --> 01:16:21.369
Snatching up this bastard boy
from America

1484
01:16:21.452 --> 01:16:24.330
and throwing him
into our kingly affairs...

1485
01:16:24.414 --> 01:16:27.041
like a chess pawn?

1486
01:16:29.419 --> 01:16:32.171
Your pawn just took
a future queen,

1487
01:16:32.255 --> 01:16:34.716
and now there can be peace.

1488
01:16:34.799 --> 01:16:36.843
And profit.

1489
01:16:38.469 --> 01:16:40.096
Well played, King Akeem.

1490
01:16:40.179 --> 01:16:42.098
Well played.

1491
01:16:49.105 --> 01:16:51.899
I need to find my mom.
I need to find my Uncle Reem.

1492
01:16:53.067 --> 01:16:55.278
We got to bust out
of this bullshit, man.

1493
01:16:55.361 --> 01:16:57.280
Wh-Why? Where are we going?

1494
01:16:57.363 --> 01:16:58.823
Home.

1495
01:17:00.325 --> 01:17:02.243
A home...

1496
01:17:02.327 --> 01:17:05.705
A home that we can build
together.

1497
01:17:24.349 --> 01:17:26.434
Uh, where is Prince Lavelle?

1498
01:17:26.517 --> 01:17:29.604
My prince asked me to stay here
about an hour ago.

1499
01:17:33.816 --> 01:17:37.820
Prince Lavelle Junson was seen
fleeing with the royal groomer.

1500
01:17:37.904 --> 01:17:39.655
And he took his Uncle Reem

1501
01:17:39.739 --> 01:17:41.342
and that wretched woman
with him, as well.

1502
01:17:41.366 --> 01:17:43.034
Show respect.

1503
01:17:43.117 --> 01:17:45.119
She is still
the mother of my son.

1504
01:17:45.203 --> 01:17:47.497
She took the royal jet.

1505
01:17:47.580 --> 01:17:49.248
That thieving bitch.

1506
01:17:49.332 --> 01:17:50.833
King Akeem.

1507
01:17:51.876 --> 01:17:53.836
Where is your prince?

1508
01:17:53.920 --> 01:17:55.588
Ah, I do believe he has gone

1509
01:17:55.671 --> 01:17:57.799
for one of his, um,
evening strolls.

1510
01:17:57.882 --> 01:18:00.051
He does that from time to time
to clear his mind.

1511
01:18:00.134 --> 01:18:01.636
Oh.

1512
01:18:01.719 --> 01:18:04.180
I hope he's not getting
cold feet.

1513
01:18:04.263 --> 01:18:06.516
Nonsense.

1514
01:18:06.599 --> 01:18:08.017
Good.

1515
01:18:08.101 --> 01:18:11.145
Because I will be expecting
a wedding tomorrow.

1516
01:18:11.229 --> 01:18:12.688
Of course.

1517
01:18:16.609 --> 01:18:19.821
Wedding bells, wedding bells.

1518
01:18:21.781 --> 01:18:23.825
Everything that I have
done for him,

1519
01:18:23.908 --> 01:18:25.576
I can't believe
he has done this.

1520
01:18:25.660 --> 01:18:27.995
I make him a prince,
I give him a chance to finally

1521
01:18:28.079 --> 01:18:30.540
make something of himself,
and this is how he repays me!

1522
01:18:30.623 --> 01:18:34.168
I finally made
a friend from my own hood,

1523
01:18:34.252 --> 01:18:36.045
and now she's gone.

1524
01:18:36.129 --> 01:18:39.674
Oh, I'm-a miss her crazy ass.

1525
01:18:39.757 --> 01:18:41.551
He could've told me
about this groomer.

1526
01:18:41.634 --> 01:18:44.345
But, no, instead he runs off
to America without a word to me.

1527
01:18:44.429 --> 01:18:47.682
It is the most selfish act,
unworthy of a Joffer!

1528
01:18:47.765 --> 01:18:49.392
It is spineless!

1529
01:18:49.475 --> 01:18:51.769
Like father, like son.

1530
01:18:51.853 --> 01:18:53.396
What did you say?

1531
01:18:53.479 --> 01:18:55.440
- Uppity bitch say what?
- What?

1532
01:18:58.693 --> 01:19:01.237
You are intoxicated, my queen.

1533
01:19:01.320 --> 01:19:03.489
All kinds of
wiggity-wack stuff happens

1534
01:19:03.573 --> 01:19:06.367
when you are drunk and high,

1535
01:19:06.451 --> 01:19:10.079
including making babies

1536
01:19:10.163 --> 01:19:14.250
that you don't know
anything about.

1537
01:19:14.333 --> 01:19:16.669
Right now you are getting
very in and out of my pocket.

1538
01:19:16.752 --> 01:19:19.672
Are you trying to say
I'm out of pocket?

1539
01:19:19.755 --> 01:19:21.942
What I am saying is, when a
person is drunk, they may say

1540
01:19:21.966 --> 01:19:23.485
- something that they regret...
- So, whenever a woman

1541
01:19:23.509 --> 01:19:24.987
speaks her mind, including
our daughter, then you just...

1542
01:19:25.011 --> 01:19:26.451
...so I suggest
you mind your tongue!

1543
01:19:29.974 --> 01:19:32.018
What happened to you, Akeem?

1544
01:19:32.101 --> 01:19:36.063
You were supposed to
change things.

1545
01:19:36.147 --> 01:19:39.525
You were supposed to bring this
kingdom to the 21st century,

1546
01:19:39.609 --> 01:19:43.946
but instead,
you push our daughter aside,

1547
01:19:44.030 --> 01:19:49.035
someone who has dedicated
her life to this country.

1548
01:19:49.118 --> 01:19:51.621
And because she's a woman,

1549
01:19:51.704 --> 01:19:53.915
she can't be your heir?

1550
01:19:53.998 --> 01:19:57.001
I cannot ignore
hundreds of years of tradition.

1551
01:19:57.084 --> 01:19:58.669
I am the ruler of this land.

1552
01:19:58.753 --> 01:20:00.421
I must be strong.

1553
01:20:05.343 --> 01:20:06.761
I get it.

1554
01:20:08.262 --> 01:20:10.431
You're the king.

1555
01:20:10.515 --> 01:20:12.642
Well, I'll tell you what.

1556
01:20:12.725 --> 01:20:15.770
There are a lot of other beds
in this castle.

1557
01:20:16.771 --> 01:20:19.982
I suggest you find another one.

1558
01:20:20.066 --> 01:20:24.362
Would you dare banish me
from my own bedroom?

1559
01:20:24.445 --> 01:20:26.155
Are you a fool?

1560
01:20:26.239 --> 01:20:29.742
Do you see me hopping on one leg
and barking like a dog?

1561
01:20:56.060 --> 01:20:57.728
What the hell is going on here?

1562
01:20:57.812 --> 01:20:59.355
He's in the back.

1563
01:20:59.438 --> 01:21:01.649
He's been here for hours.

1564
01:21:07.405 --> 01:21:08.656
Akeem.

1565
01:21:10.825 --> 01:21:12.868
How you doing, son?

1566
01:21:14.120 --> 01:21:16.163
I used to quite enjoy mopping.

1567
01:21:16.247 --> 01:21:18.666
It was simple,
and it made sense.

1568
01:21:23.004 --> 01:21:25.923
Every day, I have moved
closer to the comfort of life,

1569
01:21:26.007 --> 01:21:28.050
and now my eyes are open,

1570
01:21:28.134 --> 01:21:29.969
and the man that
I always wanted to be

1571
01:21:30.052 --> 01:21:31.679
is on the other side
of the world.

1572
01:21:31.762 --> 01:21:33.306
Lavelle.

1573
01:21:33.389 --> 01:21:36.892
Yes, he has fleed to America
for love just as I did.

1574
01:21:36.976 --> 01:21:38.728
And now,
because of my stubbornness,

1575
01:21:38.811 --> 01:21:40.771
I have run off my own son.

1576
01:21:42.064 --> 01:21:43.774
Failed him as a father.

1577
01:21:43.858 --> 01:21:46.402
You're not just a father.

1578
01:21:46.485 --> 01:21:48.112
You're the king.

1579
01:21:48.195 --> 01:21:51.198
And heavy lies the head
that wears the crown.

1580
01:21:51.282 --> 01:21:53.993
Yes, I understand
that expression more now.

1581
01:21:54.076 --> 01:21:56.537
It's not so much the crown
that is so heavy.

1582
01:21:56.621 --> 01:22:00.041
It's everything
that comes with it. Hmm?

1583
01:22:00.124 --> 01:22:01.834
You've got your country to run

1584
01:22:01.917 --> 01:22:04.754
and a crazy-ass general
breathing down your neck.

1585
01:22:04.837 --> 01:22:06.672
And on top of all that,

1586
01:22:06.756 --> 01:22:09.508
you got to be
a husband and a father.

1587
01:22:09.592 --> 01:22:11.719
Yes, you can see
that is most troubling.

1588
01:22:11.802 --> 01:22:13.512
- Oh, I get it.
- Of course you get it.

1589
01:22:13.596 --> 01:22:15.598
You are the king
of your own castle.

1590
01:22:15.681 --> 01:22:18.100
And the troubles never stop,
Akeem.

1591
01:22:18.184 --> 01:22:20.227
When I introduced the McFlurby,

1592
01:22:20.311 --> 01:22:21.979
the McDonald's lawyers
came after me

1593
01:22:22.063 --> 01:22:24.565
the same way this General Izzi
is coming after you.

1594
01:22:24.649 --> 01:22:28.235
Cease-and-desist letters,
copyright infringement.

1595
01:22:28.319 --> 01:22:32.448
I mean, the McFlurby
is nothing like the McFlurry.

1596
01:22:32.531 --> 01:22:35.326
We put our toppings
on the bottom.

1597
01:22:36.786 --> 01:22:38.371
So you have to stay strong.

1598
01:22:38.454 --> 01:22:40.289
And you have to put
McDowell's first.

1599
01:22:40.373 --> 01:22:42.917
- I am McDowell's.
- And I am Zamunda.

1600
01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:44.293
It's not the Golden Arches.

1601
01:22:44.377 --> 01:22:46.420
It's the Golden Arcs.

1602
01:22:46.504 --> 01:22:47.838
And I'm the boss.

1603
01:22:47.922 --> 01:22:50.007
And I am the MF'ing king.

1604
01:22:50.091 --> 01:22:51.342
You damn right you are.

1605
01:22:51.425 --> 01:22:54.261
Cleo, thank you.

1606
01:22:54.345 --> 01:22:57.056
I much needed to hear
the wisdom of a father.

1607
01:22:57.139 --> 01:22:58.891
Well, I'm sure your father
would understand

1608
01:22:58.974 --> 01:23:01.310
- what you're going through.
- Yes.

1609
01:23:04.021 --> 01:23:05.022
Akeem.

1610
01:23:06.607 --> 01:23:09.318
What do you think
your mother would say now?

1611
01:23:10.528 --> 01:23:12.405
My mother?

1612
01:23:12.488 --> 01:23:14.365
The queen.

1613
01:23:14.448 --> 01:23:18.619
I always thought that she was
the wisest of all the Joffers.

1614
01:23:18.703 --> 01:23:21.122
What do you think
she would say to you now, son?

1615
01:23:31.173 --> 01:23:32.675
Zamundans, rise.

1616
01:23:32.758 --> 01:23:34.135
Prepare the royal jet.

1617
01:23:34.218 --> 01:23:35.636
I shall return to America

1618
01:23:35.720 --> 01:23:37.805
and retrieve
this errant child of mine.

1619
01:23:37.888 --> 01:23:39.765
General Izzi will return
in one day,

1620
01:23:39.849 --> 01:23:43.060
and if there's no wedding,
he most certainly will attack.

1621
01:23:43.144 --> 01:23:45.104
You stay here
and protect my family.

1622
01:23:45.187 --> 01:23:47.523
I'm no warrior, Your Majesty.

1623
01:23:47.606 --> 01:23:48.941
Remember who you are.

1624
01:23:49.024 --> 01:23:50.484
You are a son of Zamunda.

1625
01:23:50.568 --> 01:23:52.570
Be strong.

1626
01:23:58.492 --> 01:24:00.411
And I'll tell you
something else.

1627
01:24:00.494 --> 01:24:02.079
I only like redbone gals.

1628
01:24:02.163 --> 01:24:04.582
Oh, see, that's where we part.
I like my women Black.

1629
01:24:04.665 --> 01:24:05.875
I want a woman so Black,

1630
01:24:05.958 --> 01:24:07.626
when you make love,
you need a flashlight.

1631
01:24:07.710 --> 01:24:09.211
I'm looking for
the good stuff, man.

1632
01:24:09.295 --> 01:24:10.546
Hey! Mufasa!

1633
01:24:10.629 --> 01:24:12.965
Hey, I hear you got
your boy back.

1634
01:24:13.048 --> 01:24:14.842
My son has returned to Queens.

1635
01:24:14.925 --> 01:24:16.153
It is most urgent
that I find him.

1636
01:24:16.177 --> 01:24:17.696
You know, he was here
a little while ago

1637
01:24:17.720 --> 01:24:19.531
with a fine little, pretty
African thing. Wasn't she fine?

1638
01:24:19.555 --> 01:24:21.891
- Mm-hmm!
- Yeah, talking about getting her a job here.

1639
01:24:21.974 --> 01:24:23.684
Then they gonna
save up her money.

1640
01:24:23.768 --> 01:24:25.746
- Then she gonna get her own place.
- That's right.

1641
01:24:25.770 --> 01:24:27.372
I told her she could start
right now, she was so fine.

1642
01:24:27.396 --> 01:24:30.036
- That's right.
- But, she... they had to go off to their nuptials.

1643
01:24:31.233 --> 01:24:32.651
Nuptials?

1644
01:24:32.735 --> 01:24:34.278
- Yeah.
- Where?

1645
01:24:34.361 --> 01:24:35.780
Near that Chinese restaurant

1646
01:24:35.863 --> 01:24:37.573
where I caught the runs
last Saturday.

1647
01:24:37.656 --> 01:24:39.158
- What?
- Oh, King Yum's.

1648
01:24:39.241 --> 01:24:40.385
Gentlemen,
I have no time for this.

1649
01:24:40.409 --> 01:24:42.328
That egg foo yong
made me have to stop off

1650
01:24:42.411 --> 01:24:45.498
at my sister's last week
and make an emergency dump.

1651
01:24:45.581 --> 01:24:47.082
Silence!

1652
01:24:47.166 --> 01:24:48.643
I have no time to listen
to your stories

1653
01:24:48.667 --> 01:24:49.794
about your bowel movements.

1654
01:24:49.877 --> 01:24:51.837
Where is the ceremony?

1655
01:24:51.921 --> 01:24:54.423
- Church of Holy Jubilation.
- Thank you.

1656
01:24:55.716 --> 01:24:57.843
You're welcome.

1657
01:25:00.137 --> 01:25:02.598
Who the hell he think
he talking to? Coming in here...

1658
01:25:02.681 --> 01:25:04.409
Just 'cause he a king.
I got a dog named King.

1659
01:25:04.433 --> 01:25:05.660
Yeah, he ain't
the king of this shop.

1660
01:25:05.684 --> 01:25:07.394
- I'm the king of this shop.
- Exactly.

1661
01:25:07.478 --> 01:25:09.730
He was nicer
when he was a prince.

1662
01:25:16.904 --> 01:25:19.031
Is this a pious house of God?

1663
01:25:19.114 --> 01:25:21.575
If "pious" means cheap,
well, then you right.

1664
01:25:21.659 --> 01:25:23.619
This the best house of God
we could find

1665
01:25:23.702 --> 01:25:24.995
on a Tuesday afternoon.

1666
01:25:25.079 --> 01:25:26.872
So let's get these rings
on these fingers

1667
01:25:26.956 --> 01:25:28.999
before the all-day shrimp
ends at Sizzler's.

1668
01:25:29.083 --> 01:25:30.843
I don't even know why
they call it "all-day."

1669
01:25:30.876 --> 01:25:32.044
It ends at 6:00.

1670
01:25:32.127 --> 01:25:33.629
Look, baby,
it's about the love, okay?

1671
01:25:33.712 --> 01:25:35.297
Not the shrimp.

1672
01:25:35.381 --> 01:25:36.966
- What's a Sizzler?
- It's nothing.

1673
01:25:48.227 --> 01:25:52.064
I assume the prince has returned
from his midnight stroll

1674
01:25:52.147 --> 01:25:55.442
and is prepared
to marry my daughter.

1675
01:25:55.526 --> 01:25:58.237
My apologies, General.

1676
01:25:58.320 --> 01:26:01.782
Prince Lavelle is
currently indisposed.

1677
01:26:01.866 --> 01:26:03.701
Indisposed?

1678
01:26:03.784 --> 01:26:05.786
Really?

1679
01:26:05.870 --> 01:26:08.539
I will not continue
to be jerked around

1680
01:26:08.622 --> 01:26:10.541
like a howler monkey

1681
01:26:10.624 --> 01:26:13.127
grazing in a field
of horny goat weeds.

1682
01:26:13.210 --> 01:26:17.006
Now, you tell me,
where is King Akeem?

1683
01:26:30.519 --> 01:26:32.146
All right.

1684
01:26:32.229 --> 01:26:34.064
Let's get hitched.

1685
01:26:34.148 --> 01:26:35.774
♪ Hallelu... ♪

1686
01:26:35.858 --> 01:26:37.359
Let there be light.

1687
01:26:37.443 --> 01:26:38.527
Hey!

1688
01:26:39.987 --> 01:26:43.824
We are gathered here today

1689
01:26:43.908 --> 01:26:48.120
for the meeting
of these two beautiful souls,

1690
01:26:48.203 --> 01:26:52.166
pressed together
like a pair of sumptuous...

1691
01:26:53.208 --> 01:26:54.627
...beings.

1692
01:26:54.710 --> 01:26:56.587
Yeah, Lord.

1693
01:26:56.670 --> 01:26:59.298
- Amen! Amen!
- Amen!

1694
01:26:59.381 --> 01:27:00.799
- Feel his presence?
- Yes, Father.

1695
01:27:00.883 --> 01:27:02.134
I can't wait to go home and...

1696
01:27:02.217 --> 01:27:05.346
Look, um, I just
want to apologize.

1697
01:27:05.429 --> 01:27:10.017
I know this isn't exactly the
wedding you've always imagined.

1698
01:27:10.100 --> 01:27:12.311
I don't know why
you would apologize.

1699
01:27:12.394 --> 01:27:15.731
I'd always imagined there'd be
a womanizing, sexist officiant

1700
01:27:15.814 --> 01:27:19.693
leading a very strange ceremony
in black socks.

1701
01:27:20.736 --> 01:27:22.821
It couldn't be more perfect.

1702
01:27:22.905 --> 01:27:25.282
- So nice, I want 'em to say it twice.
- Go on, preacher!

1703
01:27:25.366 --> 01:27:26.575
Amen!

1704
01:27:26.659 --> 01:27:28.702
- Say it again.
- Amen, girl. - Hallelujah! Amen!

1705
01:27:28.786 --> 01:27:30.138
- Yes!
- Go on, girl!

1706
01:27:30.162 --> 01:27:32.206
- Yeah!
- That's right, girl.

1707
01:27:32.289 --> 01:27:33.499
You family now.

1708
01:27:36.085 --> 01:27:37.586
Take her.

1709
01:27:38.587 --> 01:27:39.672
Keep her as a prisoner

1710
01:27:39.755 --> 01:27:43.550
until King Akeem
gives me my answer.

1711
01:27:43.634 --> 01:27:45.928
- Zoot!
- Zoot!

1712
01:27:59.108 --> 01:28:01.485
Teach this girl some respect.

1713
01:28:17.292 --> 01:28:18.836
Halt!

1714
01:28:20.129 --> 01:28:21.889
Take me to the Church
of the Holy Jubilation.

1715
01:28:21.922 --> 01:28:24.299
Sorry, pal. You're gonna
have to go into the app.

1716
01:28:24.383 --> 01:28:25.926
You can get a Lyft Lux.

1717
01:28:26.010 --> 01:28:27.153
It's rush hour surge pricing.

1718
01:28:27.177 --> 01:28:28.804
You might want
to look for a promo code.

1719
01:28:34.977 --> 01:28:38.689
Fighting is not for pretty girls
and princesses.

1720
01:28:38.772 --> 01:28:41.692
Your king and father
should have taught you

1721
01:28:41.775 --> 01:28:44.737
to be more polite,

1722
01:28:44.820 --> 01:28:46.822
not so nasty.

1723
01:28:49.199 --> 01:28:51.577
Oh?

1724
01:28:55.497 --> 01:28:59.043
Defend yourself, you sweat
from a baboon's balls.

1725
01:29:22.274 --> 01:29:23.275
Meeka!

1726
01:29:38.040 --> 01:29:39.708
Perhaps now you would like

1727
01:29:39.792 --> 01:29:42.586
to solve your problems
diplomatically.

1728
01:29:45.339 --> 01:29:47.341
Do I have your attention?

1729
01:29:49.343 --> 01:29:50.469
I'm listening.

1730
01:29:51.762 --> 01:29:54.848
Now it's time for
the main event, young folks.

1731
01:29:54.932 --> 01:29:58.143
Lavelle Junson, do you take...

1732
01:29:58.227 --> 01:30:00.354
Stop!

1733
01:30:01.855 --> 01:30:04.733
Did you run here
all the way from Africa?

1734
01:30:04.817 --> 01:30:07.152
Lavelle, you cannot do this.

1735
01:30:07.236 --> 01:30:09.530
And you cannot turn your back
on your family.

1736
01:30:09.613 --> 01:30:11.716
- Family?! Let me tell you something!
- Oh!

1737
01:30:11.740 --> 01:30:12.801
- I raised that boy!
- You ain't gonna

1738
01:30:12.825 --> 01:30:14.034
run in here from Zamunda...

1739
01:30:14.118 --> 01:30:16.328
I know what I am to you!

1740
01:30:16.411 --> 01:30:19.289
I heard everything
General Izzi said to you.

1741
01:30:19.373 --> 01:30:22.042
Using me as a chess pawn, right?

1742
01:30:22.126 --> 01:30:24.670
- Lavelle, my son...
- Don't "son" me!

1743
01:30:24.753 --> 01:30:28.257
I'm gonna live my life
with the woman I love.

1744
01:30:28.340 --> 01:30:31.802
Ain't no castle
or mountain of gold

1745
01:30:31.885 --> 01:30:33.929
that's gonna stop me
from loving her.

1746
01:30:35.180 --> 01:30:37.850
And I'm-a try my hardest
to make her happy.

1747
01:30:39.560 --> 01:30:42.312
Now, do you or do you not
understand that?

1748
01:31:01.498 --> 01:31:03.458
I do.

1749
01:31:10.007 --> 01:31:12.301
Long ago, I had your spirit.

1750
01:31:14.052 --> 01:31:18.265
I may not have been
as brave as you, Lavelle Junson,

1751
01:31:18.348 --> 01:31:21.059
but I know true love.

1752
01:31:21.143 --> 01:31:26.940
When I told my mother that
my true love was my Queen Lisa,

1753
01:31:27.024 --> 01:31:29.151
she urged me to go to her,

1754
01:31:29.234 --> 01:31:32.487
just as you have for your bride.

1755
01:31:32.571 --> 01:31:35.240
The burdens of my country
are not yours to carry.

1756
01:31:36.575 --> 01:31:38.911
And if you want to stay here
in Queens and marry

1757
01:31:38.994 --> 01:31:42.122
this fine Zamundan woman,
I shall not stand in your path.

1758
01:31:42.206 --> 01:31:45.459
I've been ruled by fear
for far too long.

1759
01:31:45.542 --> 01:31:48.253
It's time for me to start
becoming my own king.

1760
01:31:51.590 --> 01:31:53.592
My own man.

1761
01:31:55.552 --> 01:31:57.721
Just as you did, my son.

1762
01:32:03.393 --> 01:32:06.897
So, please excuse my intrusion.
Carry on, please.

1763
01:32:06.980 --> 01:32:08.374
Oh, wait, wait,
we into overtime now.

1764
01:32:08.398 --> 01:32:09.942
I need 200 more dollars.

1765
01:32:10.025 --> 01:32:12.462
What you need is to start this
ceremony before I come up there

1766
01:32:12.486 --> 01:32:14.988
- and beat your...
- Mary, Mary, if our son

1767
01:32:15.072 --> 01:32:18.242
wants to be married
in this glorious house of...

1768
01:32:18.325 --> 01:32:21.411
in-in this glorious house...

1769
01:32:21.495 --> 01:32:23.372
This is a house of God,
isn't it?

1770
01:32:23.455 --> 01:32:25.082
More like a crack house of God.

1771
01:32:25.165 --> 01:32:26.792
Ah. Then it shall be

1772
01:32:26.875 --> 01:32:28.752
as magnificent
as a palace ceremony.

1773
01:32:28.835 --> 01:32:29.920
Come. Sit.

1774
01:32:31.338 --> 01:32:33.090
Yes, continue.

1775
01:32:33.173 --> 01:32:35.008
This doesn't feel right.

1776
01:32:35.092 --> 01:32:37.761
What?
You don't want to get married?

1777
01:32:37.844 --> 01:32:41.348
No, I'm not saying
I-I don't want to get married.

1778
01:32:41.431 --> 01:32:42.432
Then what?

1779
01:32:42.516 --> 01:32:44.226
Zamunda's my home.

1780
01:32:44.309 --> 01:32:46.895
It is my pride and my joy.

1781
01:32:46.979 --> 01:32:50.232
And what about your sisters?

1782
01:32:50.315 --> 01:32:52.025
You think they don't need you?

1783
01:32:53.235 --> 01:32:54.861
Well, um...

1784
01:32:56.113 --> 01:32:58.115
...maybe we should get married
at the palace.

1785
01:32:58.198 --> 01:33:00.492
But what about your people here?

1786
01:33:00.575 --> 01:33:03.161
What about the land of Queens?

1787
01:33:03.245 --> 01:33:04.413
Wait.

1788
01:33:05.414 --> 01:33:07.624
Hear me now.

1789
01:33:07.708 --> 01:33:10.419
I am King Akeem Joffer,

1790
01:33:10.502 --> 01:33:13.130
and I'm bestowed
with great power.

1791
01:33:13.213 --> 01:33:17.551
I shall bring Queens to Zamunda!

1792
01:33:17.634 --> 01:33:19.094
Yes!

1793
01:33:19.177 --> 01:33:20.554
That's what I'm talking about.

1794
01:33:20.637 --> 01:33:22.514
They still wear silk.

1795
01:33:22.597 --> 01:33:24.975

I think my kingdom was safer

01:35:36.815 --> 01:35:41.528
I simply acted as my father
and king has instructed.

1836
01:35:41.611 --> 01:35:44.364
And that is why
I've issued a decree to Baba.

1837
01:35:46.158 --> 01:35:48.368
When I am gone,

1838
01:35:48.452 --> 01:35:51.621
Meeka Joffer shall rule
as queen.

1839
01:35:51.705 --> 01:35:54.040
- But the laws.
- Will change.

1840
01:35:54.124 --> 01:35:57.586
With more changes to come
with your guidance.

1841
01:35:57.669 --> 01:35:59.337
And what about Prince Lavelle?

1842
01:35:59.421 --> 01:36:02.841
Prince Lavelle shall serve
as an ambassador to America.

1843
01:36:02.924 --> 01:36:04.926
Thank you.

1844
01:36:05.010 --> 01:36:07.012
And as your brother.

1845
01:36:11.725 --> 01:36:13.727
Forgive an old fool.

1846
01:36:15.479 --> 01:36:19.316
Old fool
who loves you very much.

1847
01:36:26.281 --> 01:36:28.325
- Hi. How y'all doing?
- This is Mary.

1848
01:36:28.408 --> 01:36:29.910
Y'all look good tonight.

1849
01:36:29.993 --> 01:36:31.203
Hey. How you doing?

1850
01:36:31.286 --> 01:36:32.926
Girl, you is making
a statement with that.

1851
01:36:32.954 --> 01:36:34.223
- You is making a statement.
- Thank you.

1852
01:36:34.247 --> 01:36:36.291
King Akeem.

1853
01:36:36.374 --> 01:36:40.795
Love has once again triumphed
in Zamunda.

1854
01:36:43.131 --> 01:36:44.674
Oh, children,
you can go and play.

1855
01:36:44.758 --> 01:36:46.468
Go dance.
Shake your booties off.

1856
01:36:46.551 --> 01:36:50.096
I hear the trade routes have
reopened between our nations.

1857
01:36:50.180 --> 01:36:53.308
Yes. It will be a prosperous

1858
01:36:53.391 --> 01:36:57.020
and peaceful time
for us old heads.

1859
01:36:58.813 --> 01:37:01.191
I want to thank you
for releasing my sister

1860
01:37:01.274 --> 01:37:03.235
from her canine curse.

1861
01:37:17.832 --> 01:37:20.168
Yeah, give it up!
Give it up for Davido!

1862
01:37:20.252 --> 01:37:22.379
My man.

1863
01:37:22.462 --> 01:37:23.922
All right, all right.

1864
01:37:24.005 --> 01:37:25.465
Where are my people
from Zamunda at?

1865
01:37:28.760 --> 01:37:32.055
Dig all that. Okay, now,
where my people from Queens at?

1866
01:37:32.138 --> 01:37:33.139
Queens!

1867
01:37:33.223 --> 01:37:34.891
- Yeah!
- Hey, right here!

1868
01:37:34.975 --> 01:37:36.202
- We in the house!
- In the building!

1869
01:37:36.226 --> 01:37:37.586
- In the building!
- We in Zamunda!

1870
01:37:39.563 --> 01:37:41.565
Well, I can dig that, too.

1871
01:37:41.648 --> 01:37:44.651
We're about to fix it into overdrive, okay?

1872
01:37:44.734 --> 01:37:48.196
First of all, shout-out
to King Akeem and his family

1873
01:37:48.280 --> 01:37:51.116
for bringing my favorite artist
back to Africa...

1874
01:37:51.199 --> 01:37:52.701
Who is it? Who is it?

1875
01:37:52.784 --> 01:37:54.661
- Wait, Kendrick Lamar?
- No.

1876
01:37:54.744 --> 01:37:56.871
All right, we gonna
take this old-school now, okay?

1877
01:37:56.955 --> 01:37:58.373
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1878
01:37:58.456 --> 01:37:59.749
- Mary J. Blige.
- No.

1879
01:37:59.833 --> 01:38:01.835
- Diana Ross!
- Nope.

1880
01:38:01.918 --> 01:38:04.629
He's my cousin.
He's also my inspiration.

1881
01:38:04.713 --> 01:38:07.257
Okay? He's the wind
beneath my wings.

1882
01:38:07.340 --> 01:38:08.675
Don't play.

1883
01:38:08.758 --> 01:38:10.278
Who could be better
than Diana Ross? Tell me!

1884
01:38:10.302 --> 01:38:11.988
- Oh, you'll see.
- Okay, I want y'all

1885
01:38:12.012 --> 01:38:14.764
to put your hands together
for Randy Watson!

1886
01:38:14.848 --> 01:38:16.534
Randy Watson in here?!

1887
01:38:16.558 --> 01:38:18.935
- And his band...
- Oh, Lord.

1888
01:38:19.019 --> 01:38:21.271
