00:00:08.688 --> 00:00:12.435
NWS has upgraded the storm
Telmar to a category 2.

3
00:00:12.435 --> 00:00:16.452
Heavy rain and wind speed up to
85 mph are to be expected.

4
00:00:16.608 --> 00:00:19.806
This is Desert Eagle.
Still no visual on the 3 missing hikers.

5
00:00:21.017 --> 00:00:23.779
Bravo, Charlie, please confirm
CIS with rescue ops.

6
00:00:24.002 --> 00:00:24.884
Come on!

7
00:00:25.067 --> 00:00:27.359
This is Rescue Team One,
Lima Charlie.

8
00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.300
Our dogs are negative on the hikers,
but it's getting worse down here.

9
00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:34.357
- Storm is speeding up.
- Desert Eagle, what's the status up there?

10
00:00:34.658 --> 00:00:38.263
There is a flood throughout building.
Gonna get your guys off the mountain. Over.

11
00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.935
All teams to higher ground.
Big fall of water coming.

12
00:00:43.084 --> 00:00:45.677
Rescue ops - retreat
or seek shelter.

13
00:00:46.004 --> 00:00:48.504
Where's that volunteer on horse back?
He's not on radio.

14
00:00:49.111 --> 00:00:52.547
He's gotta be on his way back.
He'd be crazy to downhill this.

15
00:00:57.983 --> 00:01:00.851
Too much turbulence.
We bring it in before we're back here.

17
00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:46.033
- Hey! Hey!
- Hey. Over here!

18
00:01:46.172 --> 00:01:47.857
- Help us!
- Hey!

19
00:01:48.683 --> 00:01:51.309
The water is going. There is
a lot of water coming.

20
00:01:51.309 --> 00:01:52.152
Get on!

21
00:01:52.589 --> 00:01:54.817
I'm here with my wife.
Have you seen my wife?

22
00:01:54.817 --> 00:01:57.814
- Come on. Get on.
- You got us go and she could be right down there.

23
00:01:57.964 --> 00:02:01.418
She's not. I found her down the river.
She's gone.

24
00:02:01.418 --> 00:02:04.671
- Please, Jaime, let's go!
- I'm gonna go find her.

25
00:02:04.671 --> 00:02:05.618
Jaime!

26
00:02:17.724 --> 00:02:18.511
Come on down!

27
00:02:19.924 --> 00:02:21.476
Get over that round rock!

28
00:02:30.532 --> 00:02:31.411
Come on, boy.

29
00:02:46.947 --> 00:02:50.577
Get in close.
Hold as tight as you can!

30
00:02:52.473 --> 00:02:53.704
Are we gonna die?

31
00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.513
- So where did you find them?
- 2 miles down stream at Base Canyon.

32
00:03:30.513 --> 00:03:33.518
- Did you get a positive ID?
- Not yet, it's pretty torn up.

33
00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:40.649
Hey, who is he?

34
00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:44.074
Volunteers from time
to time, captain.

35
00:03:44.074 --> 00:03:46.554
Nam burning op,
but he's a hell of a tracker.

36
00:03:47.586 --> 00:03:48.653
You alright, John?

37
00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:54.602
Wife got killed in the first wave,
husband ran away.

38
00:03:55.097 --> 00:03:57.039
Yeah, we found them about
a mile down the river.

39
00:04:01.035 --> 00:04:02.605
You did what you could, John.

40
00:04:03.284 --> 00:04:06.002
And we appreciate
your help, again.

41
00:04:16.344 --> 00:04:17.241
Hey, Mr.

42
00:04:21.206 --> 00:04:22.287
Thank you.

43
00:04:28.972 --> 00:04:29.872
You're welcome.

44
00:04:51.991 --> 00:04:52.771
Good boy.

45
00:05:16.318 --> 00:05:18.475
- Are you tired?
- I am.

46
00:05:18.713 --> 00:05:20.803
You must be freezing.

47
00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:24.331
Hot coffee will help
you warm up.

48
00:05:30.958 --> 00:05:32.365
I heard the news.

49
00:05:33.887 --> 00:05:35.174
Two people died.

50
00:05:36.521 --> 00:05:37.993
Couldn't save them.

51
00:05:39.161 --> 00:05:41.420
Couldn't save my brothers
in the war either.

52
00:05:42.366 --> 00:05:46.114
You cannot blame yourself because
you gonna save some people.

53
00:05:47.564 --> 00:05:50.390
You are not in the war anymore.

54
00:05:51.711 --> 00:05:53.351
Only in your head.

55
00:05:54.584 --> 00:05:55.985
It's hard to turn off.

56
00:05:59.265 --> 00:06:02.387
Sitting there, you remind
me of your father.

57
00:06:03.971 --> 00:06:07.599
He would sit outside,
in his rocking chair.

58
00:06:09.175 --> 00:06:12.191
Always thinking,
never talking.

59
00:06:12.804 --> 00:06:14.838
But you have done a
wonderful job here.

60
00:06:16.318 --> 00:06:17.848
Running this place.

61
00:06:18.363 --> 00:06:21.145
I can't thank you enough
for letting me stay.

62
00:06:21.145 --> 00:06:23.172
And helping raise Gabriella.

63
00:06:28.704 --> 00:06:29.784
Thanks.

64
00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:33.565
Good night, Maria.

65
00:07:58.789 --> 00:08:00.391
Easy, easy, easy.

66
00:08:00.424 --> 00:08:01.859
Good boy. Come on. Turn.

67
00:08:03.093 --> 00:08:04.395
Hold, son. Hold, son.

68
00:08:12.903 --> 00:08:14.671
Come on, son. That's it.

69
00:08:14.704 --> 00:08:15.740
Turn, turn.

70
00:08:16.706 --> 00:08:18.042
Come on. Come on, son.

71
00:08:19.443 --> 00:08:20.378
Come on.

72
00:08:36.893 --> 00:08:38.963
Buenos días.

73
00:08:40.497 --> 00:08:41.832
How did you sleep?

74
00:08:42.732 --> 00:08:43.934
Pretty good.

75
00:08:45.902 --> 00:08:47.638
I didn't see Gabri's car.

76
00:08:47.671 --> 00:08:50.007
She called. She's fine, John.

77
00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:52.042
She's at Antonia's.

78
00:08:52.075 --> 00:08:56.146
I was hoping she'd help me ride
that new bald-faced stallion.

79
00:08:56.179 --> 00:08:59.650
She'd like that horse.
He turns great. Great turner.

80
00:09:01.885 --> 00:09:04.221
Yeah.

81
00:09:04.254 --> 00:09:06.123
You know,
she'd be a good trainer.

82
00:09:06.156 --> 00:09:08.592
She's got a way with horses.

83
00:09:08.625 --> 00:09:09.860
Don't you think?

84
00:09:09.893 --> 00:09:10.961
Mm, maybe.

85
00:09:11.962 --> 00:09:14.498
But she is going to college.

86
00:09:14.531 --> 00:09:17.534
You think she wants to smell like
horses all the time like you?

87
00:09:19.014 --> 00:09:20.059
That bad?

88
00:09:20.477 --> 00:09:23.381
Not at all,
if you like horses.

89
00:10:02.491 --> 00:10:04.804
- Hey!
- Hey! Over here!

90
00:10:04.804 --> 00:10:05.830
Have you seen my wife?

91
00:10:11.943 --> 00:10:13.245
Make no mistake about it.

92
00:10:15.112 --> 00:10:17.649
We are going to win.

93
00:10:17.682 --> 00:10:20.151
I can assure you that,
militarily,

94
00:10:20.184 --> 00:10:22.053
this strategy will not succeed.

95
00:10:27.925 --> 00:10:29.794
- Uncle John!
- In here!

96
00:10:32.697 --> 00:10:34.566
Hey.

97
00:10:34.599 --> 00:10:35.567
Afternoon.

98
00:10:36.801 --> 00:10:38.670
Did you finish
working out the horses?

99
00:10:39.303 --> 00:10:40.739
Yeah, pretty much.

100
00:10:44.909 --> 00:10:46.044
What you working on?

101
00:10:49.246 --> 00:10:50.849
You know what this is?

102
00:10:51.716 --> 00:10:52.850
A small knife.

103
00:10:52.883 --> 00:10:54.919
No, it's Damascus steel.

104
00:10:54.952 --> 00:10:58.122
It's a letter opener I made for
when you go away to college.

105
00:10:58.155 --> 00:11:00.325
And I'm gonna add on
these white handles.

106
00:11:01.092 --> 00:11:02.694
Letter opener?

107
00:11:02.727 --> 00:11:04.662
It'd be beautiful
on your desk.

108
00:11:04.695 --> 00:11:06.898
Oh.

109
00:11:06.931 --> 00:11:10.669
Uh, I hate to break it to you,
but nobody writes letters anymore.

110
00:11:13.838 --> 00:11:15.874
Well, then you can use it
to keep the boys away.

111
00:11:17.308 --> 00:11:18.861
- Anyway.
- Okay.

112
00:11:19.162 --> 00:11:21.205
- Push
- Okay, jeez.

113
00:11:23.765 --> 00:11:26.171
- Have to grease theses hinges.
- I can help.

114
00:11:26.171 --> 00:11:28.159
Okay.
How did it go last night?

115
00:11:28.159 --> 00:11:30.159
Well, not that many poople
showed up to the party.

116
00:11:30.886 --> 00:11:32.708
- Why not?
- Because of the rain.

117
00:11:36.135 --> 00:11:37.932
Grandma told me what
happened last night.

118
00:11:39.536 --> 00:11:40.878
About the people who died.

119
00:11:42.997 --> 00:11:43.628
You okay?

120
00:11:45.327 --> 00:11:47.354
You know it's not
your fault, right?

121
00:11:47.354 --> 00:11:48.295
You tried.

122
00:11:51.073 --> 00:11:52.213
I did try.

123
00:11:54.135 --> 00:11:55.173
Do you want to go to ride?

124
00:11:55.916 --> 00:11:57.950
- Yeah, go puts your boots on.
- Okay.

125
00:12:02.306 --> 00:12:04.726
It's crazy.
I'm about to start college.

126
00:12:05.568 --> 00:12:08.186
I don't know why.
I have no idea what I want to do yet.

127
00:12:09.352 --> 00:12:11.121
Did you know what you
wanted to do at my age?

128
00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:14.595
Yeah,
I wanted to be a soldier.

129
00:12:15.117 --> 00:12:16.641
At my age?

130
00:12:16.641 --> 00:12:18.127
Even before your age.

131
00:12:19.349 --> 00:12:20.906
Did you like it?

132
00:12:20.906 --> 00:12:25.164
Well, I had some of the best
friends I ever had for a while.

133
00:12:26.511 --> 00:12:28.514
It's gonna be real
quiet around here

134
00:12:28.514 --> 00:12:31.877
without you asking
all these questions.

135
00:12:32.835 --> 00:12:35.372
- I'm sure you'll survive.
- Yeah.

136
00:12:38.213 --> 00:12:39.640
The sun's setting.
I only have about an hour

137
00:12:39.640 --> 00:12:40.862
left to ride, okay?

138
00:12:40.980 --> 00:12:44.139
- Why is that?
- I have to go to Antonia's.

139
00:12:44.139 --> 00:12:47.696
She's throwing this thing for the guys
who are going to college in the fall.

140
00:12:49.478 --> 00:12:51.347
Why don't you invite them here?

141
00:12:51.380 --> 00:12:52.481
What?

142
00:12:52.514 --> 00:12:53.683
Bring them over here.

143
00:12:54.965 --> 00:12:57.034
Remember what happened
last time?

144
00:12:57.067 --> 00:12:59.364
- You freaked them out.
- Why?

145
00:12:59.364 --> 00:13:01.233
Because you wouldn't stop
staring at them.

146
00:13:01.266 --> 00:13:02.686
Oh, no.

147
00:13:02.686 --> 00:13:05.189
Yeah, I do that sometimes,
but it's not intentional.

148
00:13:06.723 --> 00:13:08.726
Thank you,
but Antonia's got it covered.

149
00:13:08.759 --> 00:13:10.595
We're just gonna
have it there, okay?

150
00:13:13.196 --> 00:13:14.632
Show them the tunnels.

151
00:13:15.932 --> 00:13:17.034
What?

152
00:13:17.067 --> 00:13:18.836
Show them the tunnels.

153
00:13:18.869 --> 00:13:21.338
You don't let anybody go
in the tunnels.

154
00:13:21.371 --> 00:13:24.942
No, but they're your friends,

155
00:13:24.975 --> 00:13:26.010
so they're welcome.

156
00:13:27.377 --> 00:13:29.975
- Okay, cool. Yeah.
- Yeah, show them the tunnels.

157
00:13:29.975 --> 00:13:32.112
- Yeah, that would be fun.
- Yeah.

158
00:13:32.678 --> 00:13:35.648
Hey, I'm really gonna miss
riding with you.

159
00:13:37.416 --> 00:13:39.252
I'm gonna miss
riding with you too.

160
00:13:47.593 --> 00:13:48.794
Get ready.

161
00:13:48.827 --> 00:13:50.163
Whoa!

162
00:13:51.630 --> 00:13:54.400
Isn't this cool?
He's never let anyone down here.

163
00:13:54.433 --> 00:13:55.868
This is crazy, man.

164
00:13:56.620 --> 00:13:59.053
This music is awful.

165
00:13:59.505 --> 00:14:01.107
If her mother heard this.

166
00:14:01.178 --> 00:14:02.638
Do you like it?

167
00:14:02.818 --> 00:14:04.353
I could get used to it.

168
00:14:05.577 --> 00:14:08.514
I hope she's having
a good time.

169
00:14:08.547 --> 00:14:11.217
You never let me
in the tunnels. Hmm?

170
00:14:13.352 --> 00:14:16.188
If you really wanna go in,
I'll take you on a guided tour.

171
00:14:16.221 --> 00:14:18.591
No, thank you. Too dirty.

172
00:14:18.624 --> 00:14:20.659
It is that.

173
00:14:35.474 --> 00:14:37.676
This is a great place
for a party, baby.

174
00:14:37.709 --> 00:14:40.179
Not right now, okay?
I have a lot on my mind.

175
00:14:40.212 --> 00:14:41.314
No, I understand.

176
00:14:42.748 --> 00:14:45.084
-Did you draw that?
-Yeah.

177
00:14:45.117 --> 00:14:46.652
I drew that, actually,
when I was ten years old.

178
00:14:46.685 --> 00:14:48.187
That's a masterpiece.

179
00:14:48.220 --> 00:14:49.722
-Who's that?

180
00:14:51.657 --> 00:14:54.693
I gotta take this. Gizelle?

181
00:14:54.726 --> 00:14:57.530
Hey, girl, can you hear me?
The reception is not so good.

182
00:14:57.563 --> 00:14:58.664
No, no. Yeah, yeah. I hear you.

183
00:15:00.332 --> 00:15:01.334
Tell me everything.

184
00:15:08.675 --> 00:15:10.277
- Gabrielle?
- Yeah?

185
00:15:12.732 --> 00:15:15.668
What are you doing down here?
All of your friends have left.

186
00:15:15.701 --> 00:15:18.071
They made a big mess.
I'm just cleaning up.

187
00:15:19.105 --> 00:15:20.740
So, how did it go?

188
00:15:20.773 --> 00:15:23.610
Um, everyone had
a good time.

189
00:15:23.643 --> 00:15:26.679
They kept asking me why my
uncle built these tunnels.

190
00:15:26.712 --> 00:15:28.315
What did you say?

191
00:15:29.282 --> 00:15:33.219
I said that you like digging
and you're a little crazy.

192
00:15:33.252 --> 00:15:34.521
That's fair enough.

193
00:15:38.257 --> 00:15:40.493
I need to talk to you
about something.

194
00:15:40.526 --> 00:15:43.163
And I just want you to have
an open mind about it.

195
00:15:45.298 --> 00:15:46.800
I need to go to Mexico.

196
00:15:48.434 --> 00:15:49.703
Why would you
want to do that?

197
00:15:51.270 --> 00:15:53.040
Because I found my father.

198
00:15:55.341 --> 00:15:58.211
My friend Gizelle,
who lives there--

199
00:15:58.244 --> 00:16:00.781
Well, she used to live here.
Do you remember her?

200
00:16:01.848 --> 00:16:03.583
Mm-hmm.

201
00:16:03.616 --> 00:16:07.654
I asked her for a favor,
and she found him.

202
00:16:09.489 --> 00:16:11.358
He lives in a town
near hers.

203
00:16:14.327 --> 00:16:19.099
Uncle John, I have to do this.
I need to hear it from him.

204
00:16:19.132 --> 00:16:22.702
I need to understand
why he would just do that.

205
00:16:22.735 --> 00:16:25.438
Because he's not a good man.

206
00:16:25.471 --> 00:16:28.174
- Can't be that simple.
- It is.

207
00:16:28.207 --> 00:16:31.111
Uncle John, I've heard the stories.
I know you've been through a lot.

208
00:16:31.144 --> 00:16:34.881
But my world is
a lot different from yours.

209
00:16:34.914 --> 00:16:36.282
No, it's not.
It's worse.

210
00:16:36.315 --> 00:16:38.218
No, it's not.

211
00:16:38.251 --> 00:16:40.454
People don't just act bad
for no reason.

212
00:16:40.454 --> 00:16:42.899
There's no reason for a man
to throw his family away.

213
00:16:43.050 --> 00:16:44.132
He's lucky he has one.

214
00:16:44.314 --> 00:16:46.532
-Why are you getting so mad?
-Because you don't know how bad it is.

215
00:16:46.532 --> 00:16:48.534
I know how black
a man's heart can be.

216
00:16:48.567 --> 00:16:50.736
There's nothing good
out there, Gabrielle.

217
00:16:50.769 --> 00:16:52.855
-Maybe he's changed.
-Men like that don't change.

218
00:16:52.993 --> 00:16:54.164
It only gets worse.

219
00:16:54.225 --> 00:16:55.594
You changed.

220
00:16:56.227 --> 00:16:57.435
I haven't changed.

221
00:16:57.559 --> 00:16:59.662
I'm just trying to
keep a lid on it, every day.

222
00:16:59.695 --> 00:17:02.031
Uncle John,
I need you to trust me.

223
00:17:02.064 --> 00:17:05.101
I need you to know that
I'm gonna make good decisions.

224
00:17:08.237 --> 00:17:10.373
I can't control
what's out there.

225
00:17:10.406 --> 00:17:12.508
You can't just
protect me forever.

226
00:17:13.642 --> 00:17:15.177
As long as I'm around,

227
00:17:15.210 --> 00:17:16.980
he's never gonna hurt you again.

228
00:17:18.047 --> 00:17:20.349
No one is.

229
00:17:20.382 --> 00:17:23.719
You said you did what you
thought was right and left at 17,

230
00:17:23.752 --> 00:17:25.388
and nobody stopped you.

231
00:17:26.722 --> 00:17:28.024
I wish they had.

232
00:17:29.558 --> 00:17:32.662
Gabrielle, I care for you
like a daughter.

233
00:17:34.229 --> 00:17:36.198
I know you want answers.

234
00:17:36.231 --> 00:17:38.001
Just wait a little while.

235
00:17:38.734 --> 00:17:40.236
Grow up a little bit.

236
00:17:41.703 --> 00:17:43.573
Know about the world
a little bit.

237
00:17:45.808 --> 00:17:47.643
Would you do that
for me, please?

238
00:17:51.547 --> 00:17:52.983
All right.

239
00:17:56.383 --> 00:17:57.454
Thanks.

240
00:17:58.202 --> 00:17:59.537
- I'm gonna go to bed.
- Good night.

241
00:18:01.105 --> 00:18:02.040
Good night.

242
00:18:22.886 --> 00:18:25.118
He doesn't want you.

243
00:18:25.290 --> 00:18:27.257
- I just wanna know why.
- It doesn't matter.

244
00:18:27.257 --> 00:18:30.948
This man is a bastard.
He doesn't have a heart or a soul.

245
00:18:30.948 --> 00:18:32.148
What's going on?

246
00:18:32.369 --> 00:18:34.018
She wants to see
her father.

247
00:18:39.141 --> 00:18:41.110
Gabrielle, I thought
we had an understanding.

248
00:18:41.143 --> 00:18:44.346
We did. We did. I'm sorry.

249
00:18:44.379 --> 00:18:46.682
But I've been thinking
about it all night, and...

250
00:18:47.849 --> 00:18:50.152
I just want answers now,
not later.

251
00:18:50.185 --> 00:18:51.420
How did you
find him?

252
00:18:54.523 --> 00:18:55.791
Gizelle helped me.

253
00:18:55.824 --> 00:18:56.892
Gizelle.

254
00:18:57.354 --> 00:18:59.094
She is still hanging out with that girl.

255
00:18:59.281 --> 00:19:01.965
- Gizelle has bad influence on you.
- She changed.

256
00:19:01.965 --> 00:19:05.539
No, she's not.
I was very happy when she moved out of here.

257
00:19:05.582 --> 00:19:06.916
She's trying to help me.

258
00:19:06.916 --> 00:19:08.909
He won't even remember you.

259
00:19:08.909 --> 00:19:11.706
He's never been a father to you.

260
00:19:11.843 --> 00:19:13.612
That man
is more your father.

261
00:19:13.645 --> 00:19:16.115
Watching over you,
protecting you.

262
00:19:16.148 --> 00:19:18.338
These last ten years,
he was the father.

263
00:19:18.338 --> 00:19:20.205
- And not that bastard.
- Maria, go easy.

264
00:19:20.205 --> 00:19:21.474
No. Why?

265
00:19:21.944 --> 00:19:23.046
Because.

266
00:19:24.111 --> 00:19:27.294
He, simply, doesn't
deserve to see you.

267
00:19:27.459 --> 00:19:30.686
He never once went to the hospital
when your mother was dying from cancer.

268
00:19:30.975 --> 00:19:35.561
One Christmas John had to pull him off
your mother because he was beating her.

269
00:19:35.561 --> 00:19:36.630
That's enough.

270
00:19:36.663 --> 00:19:37.631
Tell her.

271
00:19:39.896 --> 00:19:41.334
I don't want you to see him.

272
00:19:42.399 --> 00:19:45.561
We won't allow you to go
to that dangerous place.

273
00:19:45.722 --> 00:19:47.055
- Please.
- Enough!

274
00:20:01.097 --> 00:20:02.032
Okay.

275
00:20:03.821 --> 00:20:06.324
You're right. I won't go.

276
00:20:08.392 --> 00:20:09.827
I'm gonna go to Antonia's.

277
00:20:09.860 --> 00:20:11.229
- Okay.
- Sorry.

278
00:20:14.999 --> 00:20:16.801
It's all right. She's a kid.

279
00:20:34.585 --> 00:20:35.787
Uncle John!

280
00:20:38.289 --> 00:20:40.258
Sorry about everything earlier!

281
00:20:40.791 --> 00:20:41.826
That's okay!

282
00:20:43.894 --> 00:20:44.896
Okay.

283
00:23:05.135 --> 00:23:06.804
Hey! Come here!

284
00:23:08.605 --> 00:23:10.541
Look at you.

285
00:23:11.070 --> 00:23:13.561
You are so beautiful.

286
00:23:13.561 --> 00:23:15.466
Time goes by but
you are still the same.

287
00:23:15.892 --> 00:23:17.939
Still a virgin?

288
00:23:18.704 --> 00:23:21.855
Relax. I'm joking.

289
00:23:22.010 --> 00:23:24.936
You must be tired from the road.

290
00:23:25.588 --> 00:23:27.657
-You want something to drink?
-No, I'm okay.

291
00:23:27.690 --> 00:23:28.891
I do.

292
00:23:31.494 --> 00:23:32.862
I'll just sit here.

293
00:23:36.766 --> 00:23:39.402
You know, I can feel you
looking around.

294
00:23:39.435 --> 00:23:40.403
What?

295
00:23:41.370 --> 00:23:42.905
It's a nice house, huh?

296
00:23:42.938 --> 00:23:44.707
Yeah, it's fine.

297
00:23:44.740 --> 00:23:46.376
I can feel you
looking at me too.

298
00:23:47.677 --> 00:23:48.845
No.

299
00:23:48.878 --> 00:23:50.880
No. You look great.

300
00:23:50.913 --> 00:23:53.583
I know I've changed.

301
00:23:54.241 --> 00:23:56.562
Life down here,
it ain't easy, my sister.

302
00:23:57.350 --> 00:23:58.657
You do what you can.

303
00:23:59.384 --> 00:24:01.253
Yeah, I get it.

304
00:24:01.286 --> 00:24:04.456
I appreciate you so much
for helping me find my dad.

305
00:24:04.489 --> 00:24:06.325
I mean, it wasn't easy,
but it's cool.

306
00:24:07.959 --> 00:24:09.862
-Let me give you something--
-No, no, no.

307
00:24:09.895 --> 00:24:11.397
You think I'm
some fucking charity case?

308
00:24:12.430 --> 00:24:14.032
No, Gizelle.

309
00:24:14.065 --> 00:24:15.901
- I didn't--
- I was kidding.

310
00:24:16.935 --> 00:24:17.921
Okay.

311
00:24:18.121 --> 00:24:20.123
I actually believed you
there for a second.

312
00:24:20.156 --> 00:24:21.891
You know I would never
hurt your feelings like that.

313
00:24:23.393 --> 00:24:24.995
...we'll go see your old man.

314
00:24:25.862 --> 00:24:26.797
Okay.

315
00:24:32.068 --> 00:24:33.870
Hyah. Come on!

316
00:24:33.903 --> 00:24:34.871
Hyah.

317
00:24:37.273 --> 00:24:38.275
Come on!

318
00:25:05.968 --> 00:25:07.904
Here it is, 172.

319
00:25:11.474 --> 00:25:12.976
Go on.
Get your daddy, girl.

320
00:25:24.087 --> 00:25:25.922
Apartment number two. Okay.

321
00:25:55.084 --> 00:25:56.352
Hola.

322
00:25:56.799 --> 00:25:57.933
Is Manuel here?

323
00:25:58.264 --> 00:25:59.512
Who are you?

324
00:26:01.265 --> 00:26:03.288
I need to talk to him.

325
00:26:03.919 --> 00:26:06.555
- What do you want?
- Who are you talking to?

326
00:26:12.576 --> 00:26:15.204
- Who is she, Manuel?
- I'll explain to you later.

327
00:26:20.136 --> 00:26:22.750
I didn't know your phone number.

328
00:26:24.320 --> 00:26:25.589
I did not expect this.

329
00:26:26.811 --> 00:26:28.080
It's been
a very long time.

330
00:26:29.180 --> 00:26:30.115
I know.

331
00:26:31.916 --> 00:26:33.752
You're all grown up now,
Gabriela.

332
00:26:36.187 --> 00:26:37.623
How did you find me?

333
00:26:39.057 --> 00:26:41.726
It wasn't easy.

334
00:26:41.759 --> 00:26:44.362
You always had a good head
on your shoulders.

335
00:26:44.395 --> 00:26:47.299
Even as a little girl,
you always did good in school.

336
00:26:50.301 --> 00:26:51.803
I need to talk to you.

337
00:26:54.972 --> 00:26:57.275
Just now you looked
just like your mother.

338
00:26:58.843 --> 00:26:59.911
Really?

339
00:26:59.944 --> 00:27:01.013
Yes, very much.

340
00:27:02.146 --> 00:27:04.816
You could almost be her twin.

341
00:27:04.849 --> 00:27:07.919
Thank you. Um, I need to--
I need to ask you a question.

342
00:27:08.986 --> 00:27:09.988
Of course.

343
00:27:11.723 --> 00:27:13.025
Why did you leave us?

344
00:27:18.329 --> 00:27:22.167
I'm just trying to understand
why you would just go like that.

345
00:27:24.235 --> 00:27:25.203
Okay.

346
00:27:29.774 --> 00:27:33.845
Because one day,
I looked at your mother and you

347
00:27:33.878 --> 00:27:37.916
and realized you both didn't
mean anything to me anymore.

348
00:27:39.817 --> 00:27:42.287
I know it's hard
to understand.

349
00:27:42.320 --> 00:27:47.793
But I wasted time
being with you...

350
00:27:49.026 --> 00:27:50.195
and her.

351
00:27:51.896 --> 00:27:54.766
And she fucking dies
and leaves me with you,

352
00:27:56.400 --> 00:27:58.804
who I never wanted.

353
00:28:03.941 --> 00:28:05.243
Any more questions?

354
00:28:07.979 --> 00:28:09.481
You don't need to come back.

355
00:28:16.310 --> 00:28:19.012
Okay.
I have to go now.

356
00:28:20.318 --> 00:28:22.387
Hey, what happened?
Girl, what happened?

357
00:28:22.420 --> 00:28:24.489
I should've listened to him.
He was right the whole time.

358
00:28:24.522 --> 00:28:26.224
-I gotta get back home tonight.
-Who?

359
00:28:26.257 --> 00:28:28.026
Fuck that!
You're not gonna drive home.

360
00:28:28.059 --> 00:28:30.295
It's too late
and you're too upset.

361
00:28:30.328 --> 00:28:33.665
Yo, let me help you.
You gotta calm down, though.

362
00:28:33.698 --> 00:28:35.934
We'll do something
to get this out of your mind.

363
00:28:38.202 --> 00:28:39.137
I'll drive.

364
00:29:04.629 --> 00:29:05.597
Hi.

365
00:29:13.812 --> 00:29:15.347
Hi. How are you?

366
00:29:20.757 --> 00:29:24.109
- Hi.
- Hi.

367
00:29:59.439 --> 00:30:00.430
Don Miguel.

368
00:30:01.857 --> 00:30:03.148
Thank you for coming.

369
00:30:04.388 --> 00:30:05.948
Do you want something to drink?

370
00:30:06.165 --> 00:30:08.766
- I don't have much time.
- Let's go straight to business.

371
00:30:11.980 --> 00:30:13.980
I heard you want to
expand your business.

372
00:30:15.103 --> 00:30:17.103
I want to grow.

373
00:30:17.321 --> 00:30:21.275
With your help I can achieve that.
We'd be partners.

374
00:30:21.275 --> 00:30:23.062
I always look for new whores.

375
00:30:23.699 --> 00:30:27.759
I've exported more than
17 000 girls last year.

376
00:30:27.759 --> 00:30:31.581
Even the ugliest ones,
can make us more than 300 000.

377
00:30:36.737 --> 00:30:39.449
Don Miguel, you look perfect!

378
00:30:40.307 --> 00:30:41.444
Leave us.

379
00:30:41.677 --> 00:30:45.901
I knew you would like our girls.
They are of the best quality.

380
00:30:46.962 --> 00:30:48.962
I heard you sent a
shipment to New York.

381
00:30:49.731 --> 00:30:51.318
Leave us, Victor.

382
00:30:51.318 --> 00:30:53.131
I need to speak to Miguel.

383
00:30:53.754 --> 00:30:57.089
So speak here.
What's the problem?

384
00:30:57.312 --> 00:31:01.150
Hugo, after you guys decide who
runs the place, let me know.

385
00:31:01.347 --> 00:31:03.560
Please give me a minute, Don Miguel.

386
00:31:05.056 --> 00:31:05.943
Victor.

387
00:31:07.483 --> 00:31:09.968
What is wrong with you?

388
00:31:10.090 --> 00:31:12.413
Do you know what's on the line?

389
00:31:13.853 --> 00:31:15.707
What are you talking about?

390
00:31:16.080 --> 00:31:18.809
I work my ass off,
getting the best whores.

391
00:31:18.809 --> 00:31:20.546
And I cannot be present
when business is happening?

392
00:31:20.598 --> 00:31:23.340
You make me look bad.

393
00:31:24.006 --> 00:31:26.790
- Go easy.
- Shut your mouth.

394
00:31:27.888 --> 00:31:30.214
This is not the time,
nor place to play around.

395
00:31:30.241 --> 00:31:32.725
There is a lot of money on the line.

396
00:31:33.927 --> 00:31:35.606
You do your way,

397
00:31:35.606 --> 00:31:37.346
and I'll do mine.

398
00:31:38.836 --> 00:31:40.353
Excuse me.

399
00:31:49.839 --> 00:31:51.731
John! John!

400
00:31:51.731 --> 00:31:54.234
-What's the matter?
-She never went to Antonia's.

401
00:31:54.267 --> 00:31:57.003
-She went to Mexico.
-What?

402
00:31:57.036 --> 00:31:58.071
Gizelle called.

403
00:31:58.374 --> 00:32:01.599
Gabriela went to see her father
and never came back.

404
00:32:02.332 --> 00:32:03.834
Did you get an address?

405
00:32:05.235 --> 00:32:06.370
And her father's too.

406
00:32:08.332 --> 00:32:09.768
What happened, John?

407
00:32:13.370 --> 00:32:16.174
-Should I call the police?
-Cops can't cross the border.

408
00:32:16.207 --> 00:32:17.942
Down there, they don't do shit.

409
00:32:19.076 --> 00:32:21.112
Please, John.
Bring my girl back.

410
00:32:21.145 --> 00:32:22.080
I'll find her.

411
00:32:57.339 --> 00:32:59.010
I can't control
what's out there.

412
00:33:00.170 --> 00:33:01.839
You can't
just protect me forever.

413
00:33:12.547 --> 00:33:14.369
Listen carefully.

414
00:33:14.369 --> 00:33:16.346
I love my dogs.

415
00:33:17.997 --> 00:33:19.997
But if they try to escape.

416
00:33:21.898 --> 00:33:23.325
It pisses me off.

417
00:33:27.468 --> 00:33:30.785
And when that happens,
they need to be punished.

418
00:33:31.039 --> 00:33:34.758
What did I tell you?
On your knees.

419
00:33:34.758 --> 00:33:39.322
If any of you think
that you can escape.

420
00:33:39.460 --> 00:33:41.029
Go for it.

421
00:33:41.256 --> 00:33:42.481
Run.

422
00:33:46.205 --> 00:33:48.205
But I will find you.

423
00:33:51.756 --> 00:33:54.385
And I will kill you.

424
00:33:54.558 --> 00:33:56.158
I give you my word.

425
00:34:51.312 --> 00:34:52.947
I'm looking for Gabrielle.

426
00:34:52.980 --> 00:34:54.282
She's not here.

427
00:34:59.820 --> 00:35:00.955
Where is she?

428
00:35:02.122 --> 00:35:03.791
I don't know anything.

429
00:35:05.192 --> 00:35:08.930
All this shit
is because of you.

430
00:35:12.366 --> 00:35:15.870
I should've broke
your fucking neck ten years ago.

431
00:35:46.260 --> 00:35:47.046
Gizelle.

432
00:35:48.555 --> 00:35:49.768
Who are you?
What do you want?

433
00:35:50.122 --> 00:35:52.286
My name is John.
We've met a few times before.

434
00:35:52.286 --> 00:35:53.884
I'm looking for Gabrielle.

435
00:35:53.884 --> 00:35:54.987
She's not here.

436
00:35:54.987 --> 00:35:56.663
Do you know
where she could be?

437
00:35:56.663 --> 00:35:57.869
I don't know.
She wanted help

438
00:35:57.869 --> 00:36:00.077
finding her old man.
That's all I know.

439
00:36:00.077 --> 00:36:03.414
You mind if I ask you a few
questions about what happened?

440
00:36:03.447 --> 00:36:04.949
Okay,
but I don't know much.

441
00:36:04.982 --> 00:36:06.451
Inside,
if you don't mind.

442
00:36:07.651 --> 00:36:08.619
Okay.

443
00:36:12.489 --> 00:36:14.558
She was so sad.

444
00:36:14.591 --> 00:36:18.129
He basically told her to fuck off,
and I just wanted to help.

445
00:36:18.162 --> 00:36:19.663
Then what happened?

446
00:36:19.696 --> 00:36:21.432
What happened?

447
00:36:21.465 --> 00:36:23.934
She was crying a lot.
And it made me feel bad.

448
00:36:23.967 --> 00:36:26.637
I didn't want to bring her back to
this shithole because it's depressing.

449
00:36:26.670 --> 00:36:28.839
I thought it might be better
if I took her out,

450
00:36:28.872 --> 00:36:31.575
calm her down, get her head
clear, maybe get some drinks.

451
00:36:31.608 --> 00:36:33.978
And then we went to this place,
and then we got separated.

452
00:36:34.011 --> 00:36:35.463
And I don't know
what happened!

453
00:36:35.463 --> 00:36:36.001
How?

454
00:36:36.138 --> 00:36:39.141
Because I drank too much.
It happens.

455
00:36:39.156 --> 00:36:40.358
I was talking to a
couple of friends,

456
00:36:40.358 --> 00:36:41.990
and then I looked up
and she wasn't there.

457
00:36:41.990 --> 00:36:44.038
And I looked for her
everywhere.

458
00:36:44.038 --> 00:36:45.673
And I thought
maybe she left.

459
00:36:45.706 --> 00:36:47.608
I don't know.
I don't know.

460
00:36:47.641 --> 00:36:49.710
She left
without saying goodbye?

461
00:36:49.743 --> 00:36:51.779
Yeah, I don't know, maybe.

462
00:36:51.812 --> 00:36:53.614
Somebody drove me there,
and I don't even know who.

463
00:36:53.647 --> 00:36:55.650
And, yeah,
I said I was fucked up.

464
00:36:55.683 --> 00:36:57.652
Was she talking to anyone,
any guys?

465
00:36:57.685 --> 00:36:58.986
What?

466
00:36:59.019 --> 00:37:01.222
Was she talking
to any guys?

467
00:37:01.255 --> 00:37:03.724
I don't know, man!
Maybe.

468
00:37:03.757 --> 00:37:05.693
She must've talked
to a few guys.

469
00:37:05.726 --> 00:37:08.796
Why you asking me all this shit?
You think I'm lying to you?

470
00:37:08.829 --> 00:37:12.066
You called my house and said she
never came back from her father's.

471
00:37:12.099 --> 00:37:13.834
Yeah,
I was giving you a heads-up.

472
00:37:13.867 --> 00:37:15.837
-Or covering your ass.
-Man, fuck you--

473
00:37:19.873 --> 00:37:21.108
Where did you get this?

474
00:37:21.141 --> 00:37:22.810
She gave it to me, man.

475
00:37:22.843 --> 00:37:24.779
It was her mother's.

476
00:37:24.812 --> 00:37:26.147
She'd never give it to you.

477
00:37:27.147 --> 00:37:28.683
You sold her out.

478
00:37:29.683 --> 00:37:30.851
She was your friend.

479
00:37:30.884 --> 00:37:32.186
Fuck you! Get out of my place!

480
00:37:37.124 --> 00:37:38.092
Look at me.

481
00:37:42.196 --> 00:37:44.332
You're gonna take me
to that club,

482
00:37:44.365 --> 00:37:46.634
and you're gonna show me
who she was with.

483
00:37:48.068 --> 00:37:49.737
Or I'm gonna hurt you real bad.

484
00:37:53.240 --> 00:37:54.275
Let's go.

485
00:38:05.152 --> 00:38:06.220
Get out.

486
00:38:17.898 --> 00:38:19.867
Shit, man.
I can't go in there.

487
00:38:19.900 --> 00:38:21.803
People know me.
I gotta live down here.

488
00:38:23.509 --> 00:38:26.446
You're gonna go inside and you're
gonna point them out.

489
00:38:26.479 --> 00:38:28.748
If you do anything else,

490
00:38:28.781 --> 00:38:32.097
then I promise I'll put a bullet
in your head before they can get me.

491
00:38:32.561 --> 00:38:33.829
Move.

492
00:38:57.470 --> 00:38:59.940
I haven't changed. I'm just
trying to keep a lid on it.

493
00:39:03.075 --> 00:39:05.112
My world is
a lot different from yours.

494
00:39:07.531 --> 00:39:09.142
Because you don't know
how bad it is.

495
00:39:09.142 --> 00:39:11.380
I know how black a
man's heart can be.

496
00:39:29.918 --> 00:39:31.754
That's the guy, man.
On the couch.

497
00:39:36.925 --> 00:39:39.294
- We're cool, right?
- Fuck off.

498
00:39:39.327 --> 00:39:40.696
Get out of here.

499
00:40:17.198 --> 00:40:18.334
I'll be back.

500
00:41:11.452 --> 00:41:12.452
Get out!

501
00:41:19.227 --> 00:41:20.224
Where is she?

502
00:41:20.958 --> 00:41:22.926
I don't know that whore.

503
00:41:38.535 --> 00:41:39.744
Where is she?

504
00:41:42.695 --> 00:41:43.730
Okay.

505
00:41:46.005 --> 00:41:48.976
Start telling me where she is,
or I'll break it off.

506
00:41:50.978 --> 00:41:52.246
Okay. Okay.

507
00:41:52.596 --> 00:41:54.392
I'll tell you!

508
00:42:46.633 --> 00:42:48.633
Girls, listen up.

509
00:42:48.971 --> 00:42:53.396
I want you available at any time!
Day or night.

510
00:42:53.763 --> 00:42:56.247
Fuck 40-50 men, at least.

511
00:42:56.858 --> 00:42:59.653
And you don't stop until
we allow you to do so.

512
00:43:00.525 --> 00:43:01.929
And no games!

513
00:43:06.518 --> 00:43:07.460
Stop here.

514
00:43:11.121 --> 00:43:12.259
Which house?

515
00:43:14.845 --> 00:43:18.404
The one on the top.
With the lights on.

516
00:44:37.827 --> 00:44:40.294
Let's go! They are all yours!
Have fun!

517
00:44:58.456 --> 00:44:59.729
Hey Gringo?
What's up?

518
00:45:01.925 --> 00:45:06.839
Subtitles by sub.Trader

519
00:46:14.835 --> 00:46:17.500
Nice.

520
00:46:22.250 --> 00:46:23.383
What do you want?

521
00:46:26.784 --> 00:46:28.550
You got lost, old man?

522
00:46:29.957 --> 00:46:32.293
Nothing?

523
00:46:33.800 --> 00:46:36.740
Or maybe I should cut off
your tongue with that knife?

524
00:46:36.740 --> 00:46:37.530
Victor.

525
00:46:40.422 --> 00:46:41.390
Arizona?

526
00:46:43.552 --> 00:46:44.524
What happened?

527
00:46:45.578 --> 00:46:48.035
You ran out of whores in America?

528
00:46:50.576 --> 00:46:52.914
- I think I know her.
- Yeah?

529
00:46:54.641 --> 00:46:56.138
Fresh meat.

530
00:47:17.560 --> 00:47:19.532
Who is she to you?

531
00:47:38.650 --> 00:47:39.464
That's enough!

532
00:47:44.480 --> 00:47:45.480
Pick him up.

533
00:47:51.805 --> 00:47:53.274
Let her go.

534
00:47:53.307 --> 00:47:54.509
What?

535
00:47:56.310 --> 00:47:57.845
Let her--

536
00:47:57.878 --> 00:48:00.612
-Let her go.
- Let her go.

537
00:48:00.612 --> 00:48:03.430
Stop playing with him.
Throw him in the barrel with acid.

538
00:48:10.160 --> 00:48:12.830
"John Rambo."

539
00:48:16.953 --> 00:48:18.288
Juanito Rambo.

540
00:48:20.991 --> 00:48:23.327
Wanna know something, Juanito?

541
00:48:23.360 --> 00:48:26.264
These girls mean nothing to me
or my customers.

542
00:48:27.965 --> 00:48:30.634
In my world, they're nothing.
They're not people.

543
00:48:30.667 --> 00:48:33.738
They're just--
They're just things.

544
00:48:34.972 --> 00:48:37.074
They have no worth
to men like us.

545
00:48:38.179 --> 00:48:41.716
So I would have not
paid attention to this...

546
00:48:43.684 --> 00:48:44.752
to her.

547
00:48:45.820 --> 00:48:48.289
But now I will.

548
00:48:48.322 --> 00:48:52.694
Because you coming here has made
it very bad for her, cabrón.

549
00:48:52.727 --> 00:48:56.665
We would've just trained her,
used her and sold her.

550
00:48:58.166 --> 00:49:00.235
But now we're gonna make
an example of her.

551
00:49:02.436 --> 00:49:03.839
I'm gonna let you live.

552
00:49:05.051 --> 00:49:08.922
- What are you talking about?
- Shut up!

553
00:49:12.247 --> 00:49:15.150
You're gonna think about this every
fucking day of your fucking life.

554
00:49:18.753 --> 00:49:21.156
Until you can't think
anymore, Juanito.

555
00:49:28.469 --> 00:49:31.512
Mark him, and
his whore as well.

556
00:49:33.037 --> 00:49:35.586
On the cheek.

557
00:49:35.770 --> 00:49:36.770
Cut deep.

558
00:50:11.362 --> 00:50:13.175
We need to
get out of here.

559
00:50:15.378 --> 00:50:16.279
Get up.

560
00:50:18.238 --> 00:50:21.242
Let me help you.
Can you stand?

561
00:50:27.915 --> 00:50:30.284
Okay, you have to get up.
They will come back.

562
00:50:40.327 --> 00:50:41.396
Let her go.

563
00:50:43.097 --> 00:50:44.132
Let her go.

564
00:50:49.454 --> 00:50:50.750
You think I'm stupid?

565
00:50:51.795 --> 00:50:53.510
No, I don't think that.

566
00:50:53.655 --> 00:50:58.065
I wanted to kill him straight away
and you didn't let me.

567
00:50:58.141 --> 00:50:59.337
You embarassed me there.

568
00:50:59.470 --> 00:51:00.445
What do you want?

569
00:51:03.318 --> 00:51:04.219
Give me his girl.

570
00:51:06.298 --> 00:51:10.322
- This is business.
- I know, but now it's personal.

571
00:51:16.327 --> 00:51:17.435
Alright.

572
00:51:26.307 --> 00:51:27.740
No, no, no!
Please. Don't!

573
00:51:58.580 --> 00:51:59.700
Who is he?

574
00:52:03.330 --> 00:52:04.922
Who is this man?

575
00:52:06.936 --> 00:52:08.594
Where did you find it?

576
00:52:13.993 --> 00:52:16.217
- No, no, no!
- Who is he?

577
00:52:19.573 --> 00:52:21.319
I don't care.

578
00:52:23.027 --> 00:52:26.609
He's lying in the dirt,
half dead.

579
00:52:26.870 --> 00:52:29.589
With my mark
on his cheek.

580
00:52:32.176 --> 00:52:33.589
Here you go.

581
00:52:44.773 --> 00:52:46.459
Now it's your turn.

582
00:53:02.063 --> 00:53:04.834
Stiches will hold
if he lays still.

583
00:53:05.372 --> 00:53:08.611
He has a concussion.
He should be in hospital.

584
00:53:09.977 --> 00:53:12.589
- I know.
- Okay.

585
00:53:16.364 --> 00:53:20.203
Because of the concussion,
he will be susceptible to

586
00:53:21.339 --> 00:53:23.339
bright lights and sound.

587
00:53:24.955 --> 00:53:27.645
He should be fine
in couple of days.

588
00:53:28.494 --> 00:53:32.517
But you should be careful,
you know this is dangerous.

589
00:53:33.495 --> 00:53:36.743
- Don't worry.
- Fine.

590
00:54:42.198 --> 00:54:43.233
You're up.

591
00:54:44.512 --> 00:54:45.447
Yeah.

592
00:54:47.215 --> 00:54:48.484
Are you okay?

593
00:54:49.717 --> 00:54:50.853
Who are you?

594
00:54:52.120 --> 00:54:53.389
Carmen Delgado.

595
00:54:54.489 --> 00:54:55.691
What is your name?

596
00:54:56.124 --> 00:54:57.126
John.

597
00:54:59.060 --> 00:55:01.730
Your truck is in the garage,
by the way.

598
00:55:04.165 --> 00:55:05.467
How did I get here?

599
00:55:07.235 --> 00:55:08.737
I brought you here.

600
00:55:08.770 --> 00:55:10.739
You don't even know me.

601
00:55:10.772 --> 00:55:12.674
Why do I have to know you?

602
00:55:13.541 --> 00:55:14.843
Um...

603
00:55:14.876 --> 00:55:16.978
You were in trouble.

604
00:55:17.011 --> 00:55:18.881
I don't know,
I would do it for anyone.

605
00:55:19.881 --> 00:55:21.617
Why were you even there?

606
00:55:22.750 --> 00:55:24.620
I'm an independent journalist.

607
00:55:25.753 --> 00:55:27.689
I was following
El Flaco...

608
00:55:29.858 --> 00:55:32.428
a pimp who drugs
and sells girls.

609
00:55:33.728 --> 00:55:36.498
I saw you in the club,
watching him.

610
00:55:38.032 --> 00:55:40.202
I saw what you did to him.

611
00:55:40.235 --> 00:55:41.937
How long have I been here?

612
00:55:42.937 --> 00:55:44.806
-Four days.
-Four days?

613
00:55:44.839 --> 00:55:46.007
Mm-hmm.

614
00:55:46.040 --> 00:55:47.042
Christ.

615
00:55:48.543 --> 00:55:49.678
You gotta tell me...

616
00:55:51.279 --> 00:55:52.914
Where are the men
that took her?

617
00:55:52.947 --> 00:55:55.150
Who did they take?
Your daughter?

618
00:55:55.183 --> 00:55:57.185
Yeah. Where is she?

619
00:55:57.218 --> 00:55:58.720
Who are they?

620
00:56:00.288 --> 00:56:01.657
The Martínez brothers.

621
00:56:02.891 --> 00:56:04.526
They took my sister.

622
00:56:06.528 --> 00:56:09.765
They found her dead from an
overdose three years ago.

623
00:56:11.065 --> 00:56:12.634
I'm sorry.

624
00:56:13.534 --> 00:56:17.639
You just gotta tell me
where you think they are.

625
00:56:17.672 --> 00:56:19.141
No, it doesn't work this way.

626
00:56:20.108 --> 00:56:21.610
There's too many of them.

627
00:56:21.643 --> 00:56:23.044
Are you crazy or what?

628
00:56:23.077 --> 00:56:25.580
I'm not thinking about that.

629
00:56:25.613 --> 00:56:27.082
All I can think about is...

630
00:56:28.750 --> 00:56:30.686
how scared she must be,

631
00:56:31.219 --> 00:56:32.821
what she's going through,

632
00:56:33.988 --> 00:56:35.824
and what your sister
went through.

633
00:56:37.225 --> 00:56:40.128
Just help me, please.

634
00:56:40.161 --> 00:56:42.064
I can't do it without you.

635
00:56:47.035 --> 00:56:48.570
- Okay.
- Thank you.

636
00:56:49.971 --> 00:56:50.906
Thanks.

637
00:57:38.349 --> 00:57:42.498
- What do you want?
- A girl, do you have young ones?

638
00:57:44.744 --> 00:57:45.744
Come in.

639
00:57:52.620 --> 00:57:55.738
We have a wide choice.
You'll enjoy it.

640
00:58:01.725 --> 00:58:02.725
20 dollars.

641
00:58:14.958 --> 00:58:18.257
- Run!
- I can't! I can't!

642
00:58:24.794 --> 00:58:27.060
- Get up! Run!
- I can't!

643
00:58:27.430 --> 00:58:28.313
They will kill me!

644
00:58:29.604 --> 00:58:31.725
What is happening over there?!
No! No!

645
00:58:35.001 --> 00:58:36.806
- Run!
- I can't!

646
00:58:44.243 --> 00:58:45.811
-Gabrielle. Come here.
- No!

647
00:58:45.844 --> 00:58:47.847
-No, Gabrielle! Gabrielle.
-No!

648
00:58:47.880 --> 00:58:49.682
It's John.

649
00:58:49.715 --> 00:58:51.817
-It's Uncle John.

650
00:58:51.850 --> 00:58:53.386
It's all right. It's all right.

651
00:58:53.419 --> 00:58:55.254
It's your uncle.
It's your uncle.

652
00:59:16.308 --> 00:59:18.844
Okay. We're going home.

653
00:59:18.877 --> 00:59:20.647
You're going home.
You're safe now.

654
00:59:45.533 --> 00:59:47.455
No one saw nothing?

655
00:59:48.956 --> 00:59:51.777
- I told you we should have killed him!
- Calm down, Victor.

656
00:59:52.197 --> 00:59:53.437
It was him.

657
00:59:53.697 --> 00:59:55.763
That fucking old man
came for his whore,

658
00:59:55.935 --> 00:59:57.070
and he took her her.

659
00:59:57.164 --> 01:00:00.494
- We will find and kill him.
- No, no, no...

660
01:00:00.702 --> 01:00:04.424
I don't care.
That's on you.

661
01:00:04.477 --> 01:00:05.922
What are you saying?

662
01:00:08.243 --> 01:00:11.846
Next time
we do it my way.

663
01:00:19.367 --> 01:00:20.664
Back to work.

664
01:00:21.759 --> 01:00:22.582
Back to work!

665
01:00:33.716 --> 01:00:34.716
Fuck!

666
01:00:58.287 --> 01:00:59.656
You came back.

667
01:01:01.693 --> 01:01:04.596
We're gonna get you back,
get you back home.

668
01:01:10.491 --> 01:01:14.728
- I'm sorry.
- No. You didn't do anything.

669
01:01:14.728 --> 01:01:16.315
You didn't do anything at all.

670
01:01:16.315 --> 01:01:18.684
We're gonna go home,
and everything's gonna be good.

671
01:01:18.717 --> 01:01:20.186
It's gonna be all right.

672
01:01:24.290 --> 01:01:25.258
Okay.

673
01:01:26.759 --> 01:01:28.461
I got this back for you.

674
01:01:40.606 --> 01:01:42.842
Gabrielle, I need you
to keep your eyes open.

675
01:01:44.877 --> 01:01:46.212
Keep your eyes open.

676
01:01:47.379 --> 01:01:48.681
Let's talk about something.

677
01:01:51.584 --> 01:01:53.920
I remember
you were a great rider.

678
01:01:55.721 --> 01:01:58.491
Every event you were in,
every competition,

679
01:01:58.524 --> 01:02:00.226
you'd win everything.

680
01:02:01.594 --> 01:02:05.231
I remember you were
just about 11 years old.

681
01:02:05.264 --> 01:02:08.368
You won five events in one day.
That's really something.

682
01:02:09.301 --> 01:02:11.571
Gabrielle, stay with me.

683
01:02:11.604 --> 01:02:14.240
You can do it.
We're gonna be home soon.

684
01:02:15.007 --> 01:02:16.576
I'll take care of you.

685
01:02:17.676 --> 01:02:20.246
You got so much life left.

686
01:02:20.279 --> 01:02:23.183
You got so many things
you gotta do.

687
01:02:24.283 --> 01:02:25.451
So many things.

688
01:02:27.920 --> 01:02:31.958
When I came home a long
time ago, you were so young.

689
01:02:31.991 --> 01:02:33.459
Gabrielle,
you were so young.

690
01:02:35.461 --> 01:02:38.298
I was lost. I was a lost man.

691
01:02:39.398 --> 01:02:41.568
And then I met you.

692
01:02:43.502 --> 01:02:47.774
And I saw something that I
didn't think I'd ever see anymore:

693
01:02:49.341 --> 01:02:53.379
Good in this world.
Some innocence.

694
01:02:53.412 --> 01:02:57.750
And I had a family that
I never thought I'd ever have.

695
01:02:57.783 --> 01:03:01.854
And raising you, it was the
best thing that ever happened to me.

696
01:03:01.887 --> 01:03:05.024
And I thank you for that.
Thank you.

697
01:03:05.057 --> 01:03:06.392
You're like the--

698
01:03:07.960 --> 01:03:10.496
Gabrielle? Gabrielle.

699
01:03:17.469 --> 01:03:19.572
Gabrielle. No, no.

700
01:03:19.605 --> 01:03:20.773
Oh, don't do it.

701
01:03:22.875 --> 01:03:23.876
Gabrielle?

702
01:03:26.845 --> 01:03:28.281
Oh, God.

703
01:03:46.699 --> 01:03:47.800
I'm sorry.

704
01:04:01.580 --> 01:04:02.882
Why not me?

705
01:04:55.868 --> 01:04:56.936
Wait!

706
01:06:28.966 --> 01:06:30.166
I miss her.

707
01:06:33.460 --> 01:06:35.162
I want you to stay
at your sister's.

708
01:06:36.923 --> 01:06:39.159
There's nothing for you here,
nothing for me here.

709
01:06:41.227 --> 01:06:42.863
Where will you go?

710
01:06:44.097 --> 01:06:45.599
I'm just gonna move around.

711
01:06:47.267 --> 01:06:48.535
Like always.

712
01:06:50.570 --> 01:06:52.005
Will I see you again?

713
01:06:53.973 --> 01:06:55.209
Mm-hmm. Sure.

714
01:07:01.080 --> 01:07:02.149
I will miss this.

715
01:07:22.970 --> 01:07:25.819
I will mourn for the
rest of my life.

716
01:07:26.458 --> 01:07:31.207
It's like my heart has
been cut off.

717
01:07:32.415 --> 01:07:33.350
Yeah.

718
01:07:38.016 --> 01:07:39.452
Travel safe.

719
01:11:05.295 --> 01:11:06.263
What do you want?

720
01:11:07.330 --> 01:11:08.665
I need your help.

721
01:11:08.698 --> 01:11:10.301
Come in.

722
01:11:13.470 --> 01:11:16.373
If someone sees you,
we both will die.

723
01:11:16.406 --> 01:11:18.275
Coming back here
is so dangerous.

724
01:11:19.456 --> 01:11:20.539
Did you find her?

725
01:11:20.678 --> 01:11:21.809
She's dead.

726
01:11:25.610 --> 01:11:26.812
Oh, I'm...

727
01:11:27.792 --> 01:11:28.985
I'm sorry.

728
01:11:30.082 --> 01:11:32.452
I really am.
I know how you feel.

729
01:11:33.686 --> 01:11:36.456
But coming back
was dangerous.

730
01:11:37.623 --> 01:11:38.992
Why are you here?

731
01:11:40.159 --> 01:11:42.395
I wanna find
the thin one.

732
01:11:42.428 --> 01:11:42.967
No.

733
01:11:43.571 --> 01:11:45.254
- The one that cut her.
- No.

734
01:11:45.254 --> 01:11:46.739
The one that cut me.

735
01:11:46.739 --> 01:11:49.175
I will not help you again.

736
01:11:49.208 --> 01:11:50.476
You have to.

737
01:11:50.509 --> 01:11:52.412
Why do I have to?

738
01:11:52.445 --> 01:11:55.215
What will it change?
Nothing.

739
01:11:56.449 --> 01:11:59.152
We grieve and move on.

740
01:12:00.486 --> 01:12:01.721
And you've done that?

741
01:12:04.690 --> 01:12:08.161
I mean,
I think of her every day.

742
01:12:09.128 --> 01:12:10.430
Every fucking day.

743
01:12:13.499 --> 01:12:15.368
But we have to move on.

744
01:12:15.401 --> 01:12:17.351
What if you can't move on?

745
01:12:17.850 --> 01:12:20.219
- What if you can't move on at all?
- But you have to.

746
01:12:20.252 --> 01:12:22.355
We have no choice.
What's done is done.

747
01:12:22.388 --> 01:12:23.490
Why is it done?

748
01:12:24.990 --> 01:12:27.160
How is it ever done?

749
01:12:29.161 --> 01:12:32.165
When I look
at something so innocent...

750
01:12:33.933 --> 01:12:37.236
and I see that face
never have life in it again,

751
01:12:37.269 --> 01:12:41.841
how is it ever done?

752
01:12:44.376 --> 01:12:46.045
I want revenge.

753
01:12:47.513 --> 01:12:51.117
I want them to know
that death is coming...

754
01:12:52.451 --> 01:12:56.322
and there's nothing
they can do to stop it.

755
01:12:57.923 --> 01:13:00.827
I want them
to feel our grief...

756
01:13:01.761 --> 01:13:06.566
and know that's the last thing
they will ever feel.

757
01:13:08.601 --> 01:13:10.537
And I know
you want it too.

758
01:15:22.401 --> 01:15:24.203
Go!

759
01:17:29.306 --> 01:17:31.306
Listen up!
Prepare!

760
01:17:31.974 --> 01:17:34.285
5 to the barn.
Rest with me!

761
01:17:41.229 --> 01:17:43.718
Bring me that
old man!

762
01:17:47.175 --> 01:17:48.141
Follow me.

763
01:17:55.992 --> 01:17:58.142
Come here!
He's in the cellar!

764
01:18:00.701 --> 01:18:01.669
Here!

765
01:18:12.186 --> 01:18:13.960
Chino, go there!
Rest with me!

766
01:18:54.392 --> 01:18:56.349
Quiet. Follow me.

767
01:19:26.674 --> 01:19:27.361
Over there!

768
01:19:59.061 --> 01:19:59.911
Go check on them.

769
01:21:13.140 --> 01:21:16.094
Chiaro, Carito.
Answer!

770
01:21:18.043 --> 01:21:20.081
Chino, Pilon.
Answer me!

771
01:22:28.510 --> 01:22:29.510
Son of a bitch!

772
01:23:48.867 --> 01:23:49.542
Here!

773
01:24:32.411 --> 01:24:33.413
They're all dead.

774
01:24:34.522 --> 01:24:36.491
All of them.

775
01:24:36.524 --> 01:24:38.426
I could've killed you
ten times.

776
01:24:40.227 --> 01:24:41.796
But I wanted you last.

777
01:24:42.997 --> 01:24:44.298
Fuck you.

778
01:24:44.331 --> 01:24:46.434
No, fuck you, dead man.

779
01:24:48.135 --> 01:24:50.772
I want you to feel my rage,

780
01:24:50.805 --> 01:24:51.940
my hate,

781
01:24:53.207 --> 01:24:55.777
when I reach into your chest

782
01:24:55.810 --> 01:24:57.846
and rip out your heart!

783
01:24:59.446 --> 01:25:00.882
Like you did mine.

784
01:25:02.255 --> 01:25:05.738
Fuck you and
your whore!

785
01:25:05.738 --> 01:25:07.373
You want to live?

786
01:25:07.406 --> 01:25:09.075
Follow the lights.

787
01:27:36.111 --> 01:27:37.881
This is what it feels like.

788
01:28:34.470 --> 01:28:36.973
I've lived in a world of death.

789
01:28:38.440 --> 01:28:40.943
I tried to come home,

790
01:28:40.976 --> 01:28:43.112
but I never really arrived.

791
01:28:44.313 --> 01:28:47.517
A part of my mind and soul...

792
01:28:48.651 --> 01:28:50.620
got lost along the way.

793
01:28:53.322 --> 01:28:57.093
But my heart was still here,

794
01:28:57.126 --> 01:28:58.595
where I was born.

795
01:29:00.162 --> 01:29:02.565
Where I would
defend to the end...

796
01:29:04.033 --> 01:29:06.402
the only family
I've ever known.

797
01:29:08.504 --> 01:29:11.207
The only home I've ever known.

798
01:29:14.109 --> 01:29:17.447
All the ones I've loved
are now ghosts.

799
01:29:20.015 --> 01:29:21.417
But I will fight...

800
01:29:23.552 --> 01:29:25.622
to keep their memories alive...

801
01:29:27.423 --> 01:29:29.577
forever.
