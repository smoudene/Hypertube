3
00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.665
Why not call it
the Big Chill or the Nippy era?

4
00:03:57.753 --> 00:04:00.790
I'm just sayin',
how do we know it's an Ice age?

5
00:04:00.881 --> 00:04:03.586
Because of all the ice.

6
00:04:06.053 --> 00:04:08.543
Well, things just got a little chillier.

7
00:04:08.638 --> 00:04:12.221
Help. Help.

8
00:04:12.308 --> 00:04:15.642
Come on, kids, let's go. The traffic's movin'.

9
00:04:15.978 --> 00:04:18.018
But, but, but, Dad.

10
00:04:18.147 --> 00:04:20.898
No buts. You can play extinction later.

11
00:04:21.233 --> 00:04:24.649
OK. Come on, guys.

12
00:04:24.903 --> 00:04:26.979
So, where's Eddie?

13
00:04:27.072 --> 00:04:30.855
He said he was on the verge
of an evolutionary breakthrough.

14
00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:33.026
Really?

15
00:04:33.536 --> 00:04:36.205
I'm flying.

16
00:04:37.498 --> 00:04:39.656
Some breakthrough.

17
00:04:40.793 --> 00:04:43.330
- Look out.
- You're going the wrong way.

18
00:04:44.337 --> 00:04:46.413
Crazy mammoth.

19
00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:57.929
Do the world a favour.
Move your issues off the road.

20
00:04:58.308 --> 00:05:02.555
If my trunk was that small,
I wouldn't draw attention to myself, pal.

21
00:05:02.729 --> 00:05:06.347
Give me a break.
We've been waddlin' all day.

22
00:05:08.151 --> 00:05:10.902
Go ahead. Follow the crowd.

23
00:05:10.987 --> 00:05:13.228
It'll be quieter when you're gone.

24
00:05:14.532 --> 00:05:17.366
Come on. If he wants to
freeze to death, let him.

25
00:05:27.418 --> 00:05:29.494
I'm up. I'm up.

26
00:05:31.922 --> 00:05:37.260
Rise and shine, everybody.
Huh? Zak? Marshall?

27
00:05:37.344 --> 00:05:40.095
Bertie? Uncle Fungus?

28
00:05:40.722 --> 00:05:46.926
Where is everybody? Come on, guys,
we're gonna miss the migration.

29
00:05:49.563 --> 00:05:53.892
They left without me.
They do this every year.

30
00:05:55.902 --> 00:05:58.903
Why? Doesn't anyone love me?

31
00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:03.657
Isn't there anyone who cares
about Sid the Sloth?

32
00:06:06.329 --> 00:06:08.487
All right, I'll just go by myself.

33
00:06:11.083 --> 00:06:12.743
Sick.

34
00:06:12.834 --> 00:06:15.586
Wide body, kerb it next time.

35
00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:18.161
Oh, jeez. Yuck.

36
00:06:18.423 --> 00:06:24.046
I can't believe it. Fresh wild greens.
Frank, where did you ever...?

37
00:06:24.136 --> 00:06:27.303
- Go ahead. Dig in.
- A dandelion.

38
00:06:27.389 --> 00:06:30.972
- I thought the frost wiped 'em all out.
- All but one.

39
00:06:32.394 --> 00:06:36.226
It makes me so... I wanna... Yuck.

40
00:06:36.314 --> 00:06:41.059
This has definitely not been my day.
You know what I'm sayin', buddy?

41
00:06:41.152 --> 00:06:44.936
What a mess. You rhinos
have tiny brains. Did you know that?

42
00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:50.025
It's just a fact. No offence. You probably
didn't even know what I'm talkin' about.

43
00:06:50.744 --> 00:06:52.155
Yummo.

44
00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:55.324
A dandelion. Must be
the last one of the season.

45
00:06:58.418 --> 00:07:00.790
- Carl.
- Easy, Frank.

46
00:07:00.878 --> 00:07:02.954
He ruined our salad.

47
00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:07.127
My mistake. That was my mistake. Let me...

48
00:07:07.676 --> 00:07:11.508
No, no, seriously, let me
take care of this. What is this?

49
00:07:11.596 --> 00:07:15.261
Pine cones. Oh, my goodness.
They're my favourite.

50
00:07:17.143 --> 00:07:21.639
Delicious. That's good eating.

51
00:07:21.897 --> 00:07:25.266
But don't let me hog them all up.
Here, you have some.

52
00:07:25.359 --> 00:07:28.146
<i>Tasty, isn't it? Bon appêtit.</i>

53
00:07:29.487 --> 00:07:31.646
Now?

54
00:07:32.115 --> 00:07:34.191
Now.

55
00:07:43.083 --> 00:07:47.127
- Just pretend that I'm not here.
- I wanted to hit him at full speed.

56
00:07:47.212 --> 00:07:52.502
- That's OK. We'll have some fun with him.
- Don't let them impale me. I wanna live.

57
00:07:52.592 --> 00:07:55.925
- Get off me.
- Come on, you're makin' a scene.

58
00:07:56.012 --> 00:07:58.798
<i>We'll just take our furry piñata and go.</i>

59
00:07:58.889 --> 00:08:01.890
If it's not them today,
it's someone else tomorrow.

60
00:08:01.975 --> 00:08:04.383
Well, I'd rather it not be today. OK?

61
00:08:04.478 --> 00:08:07.846
We'll break your neck
so you don't feel a thing.

62
00:08:07.939 --> 00:08:11.059
Wait a minute. I thought
rhinos were vegetarians.

63
00:08:11.192 --> 00:08:13.268
- An excellent point.
- Shut up.

64
00:08:13.361 --> 00:08:17.025
Who says we're gonna eat him
after we kill him?

65
00:08:17.114 --> 00:08:20.031
I don't like animals that kill for pleasure.

66
00:08:20.117 --> 00:08:23.532
- Save it for a mammal that cares.
- I'm a mammal that cares.

67
00:08:23.787 --> 00:08:28.911
OK, if either of you make it across that
sinkhole in front of ya, you get the sloth.

68
00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.867
That's right, you losers.
You take one step and you're dead.

69
00:08:37.091 --> 00:08:40.673
- You were bluffing, huh?
- Yeah. Yeah, that was a bluff.

70
00:08:41.845 --> 00:08:43.588
Get him.

71
00:09:19.629 --> 00:09:21.705
A dandelion?

72
00:09:24.550 --> 00:09:26.626
We did it.

73
00:09:35.102 --> 00:09:38.885
- You have beautiful eyes.
- Get off my face.

74
00:09:40.106 --> 00:09:44.186
Whoa, we make a great team.
What do you say we head south together?

75
00:09:44.277 --> 00:09:46.767
Great. Jump on my back
and relax the whole way.

76
00:09:46.862 --> 00:09:48.902
- Wow, really?
- No.

77
00:09:49.156 --> 00:09:53.485
Wait, aren't you going south?
The change of seasons, migration instincts.

78
00:09:53.577 --> 00:09:56.328
- Any of this a-ringin' a bell?
- I guess not. Bye.

79
00:09:56.413 --> 00:09:59.330
OK, then. Thanks for the help.
I can take it from here.

80
00:10:00.291 --> 00:10:04.075
You overgrown weasel.
Wait till we get down there.

81
00:10:04.837 --> 00:10:08.621
That south thing is way overrated.
The heat, the crowds - who needs it?

82
00:10:08.715 --> 00:10:13.294
Isn't this great? You and me,
two bachelors knockin' about in the wild.

83
00:10:13.386 --> 00:10:17.218
No, you just want a bodyguard
so you don't become somebody's side dish.

84
00:10:17.307 --> 00:10:19.632
You're a very shrewd mammal.

85
00:10:19.725 --> 00:10:22.679
OK, lead the way, Mr Big...
Didn't get the name.

86
00:10:22.770 --> 00:10:24.809
- Manfred.
- Manfred? Yuck.

87
00:10:24.897 --> 00:10:30.104
How about Manny the Moody Mammoth?
Or Manny the Melancholy... Manny the...

88
00:10:32.612 --> 00:10:34.688
Stop following me.

89
00:10:36.366 --> 00:10:42.201
OK, so you've got issues. You won't
even know I'm here. I'll just zip the lip.

90
00:11:26.244 --> 00:11:30.194
Look at the cute little baby, Diego.

91
00:11:32.583 --> 00:11:38.004
- Isn't it nice he'll be joining us for breakfast?
- It wouldn't be breakfast without him.

92
00:11:38.088 --> 00:11:43.877
Especially since his daddy wiped out half
our pack and wears our skin to keep warm.

93
00:11:43.969 --> 00:11:47.088
An eye for an eye, don't you think?

94
00:11:47.180 --> 00:11:50.762
Let's show him what happens
when he messes with sabres.

95
00:11:50.850 --> 00:11:54.016
Alert the troops. We attack at dawn.

96
00:11:55.062 --> 00:11:59.688
And, Diego, bring me that baby alive.

97
00:11:59.775 --> 00:12:05.065
If I'm gonna enjoy my revenge,
I want it to be fresh.

98
00:12:26.466 --> 00:12:28.624
Phew. I'm wiped out.

99
00:12:29.010 --> 00:12:32.627
- That's your shelter?
- You're a big guy. You got a lotta wood.

100
00:12:32.721 --> 00:12:35.508
- I'm a little guy.
- You got half a stick.

101
00:12:35.599 --> 00:12:41.968
But with my little stick and my highly
evolved brain, I shall create fire.

102
00:12:42.397 --> 00:12:44.188
Fascinating.

103
00:12:44.524 --> 00:12:48.603
We'll see if brains triumph
over brawn tonight. Now, won't we?

104
00:12:54.616 --> 00:12:56.822
Think I saw a spark.

105
00:13:00.747 --> 00:13:04.365
Any chance I could squeeze
in there with you, Manny, ol' pal?

106
00:13:04.458 --> 00:13:06.996
Isn't there someone else you can annoy?

107
00:13:07.086 --> 00:13:10.620
Friends? Family? Poisonous reptiles?

108
00:13:11.006 --> 00:13:15.715
My family abandoned me.
They just kinda migrated without me.

109
00:13:15.802 --> 00:13:18.423
You should see what they did last year.

110
00:13:18.513 --> 00:13:21.264
They woke up early and
tied my hands and feet

111
00:13:21.349 --> 00:13:24.136
and they gagged me with a field mouse,

112
00:13:24.226 --> 00:13:27.844
covered their tracks, went
through water so I'd lose their scent,

113
00:13:27.938 --> 00:13:30.773
and... who needs 'em, anyway?

114
00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:37.645
So what about you? You have family?

115
00:13:41.867 --> 00:13:45.034
OK, you're tired. I see.
We'll talk more in the morning.

116
00:13:47.581 --> 00:13:51.115
Manfred? Manfred?
Could you scooch over a drop?

117
00:13:52.169 --> 00:13:55.288
Come on. Nobody falls asleep that fast.

118
00:13:55.380 --> 00:13:57.456
Manny.

119
00:16:48.287 --> 00:16:50.445
There's Diego. Fall back.

120
00:16:57.003 --> 00:16:59.873
- Where's the baby?
- I lost it over the falls.

121
00:17:00.089 --> 00:17:02.627
You lost it?

122
00:17:05.511 --> 00:17:08.084
- I want that baby, Diego.
- I'll get it.

123
00:17:08.180 --> 00:17:11.845
You'd better, unless you want to
serve as a replacement.

124
00:17:12.017 --> 00:17:15.302
We'll go up to Half Peak. Meet us there.

125
00:17:16.688 --> 00:17:18.764
It had better be alive.

126
00:17:20.066 --> 00:17:22.557
Can we trust you with that, Diego?

127
00:17:22.651 --> 00:17:25.142
Let's go.

128
00:17:47.924 --> 00:17:51.922
She picked a hair off my shoulder and says,
"If you have an extra mating dance,

129
00:17:52.011 --> 00:17:54.585
at least pick a female
with the same colour pelt. "

130
00:17:54.764 --> 00:17:58.180
I thought "Whoa. She's gonna go
praying mantis on me. "

131
00:17:58.267 --> 00:18:02.015
If you find a mate, you should be loyal.
In your case, grateful.

132
00:18:02.104 --> 00:18:05.389
- Now get away from me.
- I think mating for life is stupid.

133
00:18:05.482 --> 00:18:07.724
There's plenty of Sid to go around.

134
00:18:09.235 --> 00:18:11.358
Manny?

135
00:18:11.946 --> 00:18:14.022
Manny?

136
00:19:06.829 --> 00:19:09.367
Look at that. He's OK.

137
00:19:21.635 --> 00:19:24.304
She's gone.

138
00:19:34.104 --> 00:19:37.520
- Manny, are you forgetting something?
- No.

139
00:19:37.649 --> 00:19:41.693
- But you just saved him.
- I'm trying to get rid of the last thing I saved.

140
00:19:41.778 --> 00:19:44.269
But you can't leave him here.

141
00:19:48.284 --> 00:19:51.818
Look, there's smoke.
That's his herd right up the hill.

142
00:19:52.079 --> 00:19:56.028
- We should return him.
- Let's get this straight. There is no "we".

143
00:19:56.124 --> 00:20:01.747
There never was a "we". In fact,
without me, there wouldn't even be a "you".

144
00:20:02.672 --> 00:20:09.552
- Just up the hill.
- Listen very carefully: I'm not going.

145
00:20:09.803 --> 00:20:14.714
- Fine, be a jerk. I'll take care of him.
- Yeah, that's good.

146
00:20:14.808 --> 00:20:18.223
You can't even take care of yourself.
This, I gotta see.

147
00:20:18.311 --> 00:20:22.605
I'll return you. We don't need
that meany-weeny mammoth, do we?

148
00:20:22.690 --> 00:20:24.813
No, we don't.

149
00:20:54.219 --> 00:20:57.634
You're an embarrassment to nature.
Do you know that?

150
00:20:58.222 --> 00:21:01.472
This is cake. I'm fine, I'm fine.

151
00:21:01.559 --> 00:21:03.635
I'm gonna die.

152
00:21:17.031 --> 00:21:18.573
Manny.

153
00:21:32.337 --> 00:21:36.251
- That pink thing is mine.
- No. Actually, that pink thing belongs to us.

154
00:21:39.301 --> 00:21:42.717
"Us"? You two are a bit of an odd couple.

155
00:21:42.804 --> 00:21:44.596
There is no "us".

156
00:21:44.681 --> 00:21:48.014
I see. Can't have one of your own,
so you want to adopt.

157
00:21:48.101 --> 00:21:51.220
Look, I'm sorry to interrupt
your snack, but we gotta go.

158
00:21:51.396 --> 00:21:54.895
The baby? Please.
I was returning him to his herd.

159
00:21:54.982 --> 00:21:57.058
Oh, yeah. Nice try, bucktooth.

160
00:21:57.151 --> 00:21:59.227
- Callin' me a liar?
- I didn't say that.

161
00:21:59.319 --> 00:22:01.395
You were thinkin' it.

162
00:22:01.488 --> 00:22:04.157
I don't like this cat. He reads minds.

163
00:22:04.699 --> 00:22:08.317
- Name's Diego, friend.
- Manfred, and I'm not your friend.

164
00:22:08.578 --> 00:22:15.659
Fine, Manfred. If you're lookin' for the
humans, you're wastin' your time. They left.

165
00:22:15.751 --> 00:22:18.917
Thanks for the advice. Now beat it.

166
00:22:19.004 --> 00:22:23.048
I'll help you bring it to its herd,
but leave me alone after that.

167
00:22:23.133 --> 00:22:26.715
- OK. OK, deal. What's your problem?
- You are my problem.

168
00:22:26.803 --> 00:22:31.132
I think you're stressed, so you eat too much.
It's hard to get fat on a vegan diet.

169
00:22:31.223 --> 00:22:35.351
I'm not fat. It's all this fur.
It makes me look poofy.

170
00:22:35.436 --> 00:22:39.350
All right, you have fat hair.
But when you're ready to talk, I'm here.

171
00:22:42.484 --> 00:22:45.852
What are you doin'? Just drop it on the ledge.

172
00:22:45.945 --> 00:22:49.112
- We should make sure they found him.
- Good idea.

173
00:22:49.198 --> 00:22:51.689
No, no. Wait, wait, wait, wait.

174
00:22:51.784 --> 00:22:53.907
Don't spear me.

175
00:22:57.289 --> 00:23:00.076
- This is a problem.
- Now what?

176
00:23:01.126 --> 00:23:03.699
That's perfect.

177
00:23:33.822 --> 00:23:36.360
- I told you they were gone.
- Look who it is.

178
00:23:36.449 --> 00:23:39.154
Don't you have some
poor animal to disembowel?

179
00:23:39.244 --> 00:23:43.075
They couldn't be far. I mean,
they went this way, or this way?

180
00:23:43.164 --> 00:23:45.536
You don't know much
about tracking, do you?

181
00:23:45.666 --> 00:23:49.498
I'm a sloth. I see a tree,
eat a leaf. That's my tracking.

182
00:23:49.586 --> 00:23:51.828
You didn't miss them by much.

183
00:23:51.922 --> 00:23:55.337
It's still green.
They headed north two hours ago.

184
00:23:55.717 --> 00:23:59.880
It's still green.
They headed north two hours ago.

185
00:24:02.223 --> 00:24:04.892
You don't need this aggravation.

186
00:24:05.851 --> 00:24:09.683
Give me the baby. I can
track humans down a lot faster than you.

187
00:24:09.771 --> 00:24:12.476
And you're just a good citizen helpin' out?

188
00:24:12.566 --> 00:24:16.100
- I just know where the humans are going.
- Glacier Pass.

189
00:24:16.194 --> 00:24:19.776
Everybody knows they have
a settlement on the other side.

190
00:24:20.740 --> 00:24:25.697
Unless you know how to track, you'll never
reach them before snow closes the pass.

191
00:24:25.828 --> 00:24:28.864
Which should be, like, tomorrow.

192
00:24:28.955 --> 00:24:34.791
So, you can give that baby to me,
or go get lost in a blizzard. It's your choice.

193
00:24:41.467 --> 00:24:45.760
Here's your little bundle of joy.
We're returning it to the humans.

194
00:24:45.846 --> 00:24:51.385
The big, bad tigey-wigey gets left behind.
Poor tigey-wigey.

195
00:24:51.476 --> 00:24:54.311
Sid, tigey-wigey is gonna lead the way.

196
00:24:57.857 --> 00:25:00.526
Manny, can I talk to you for a second?

197
00:25:00.609 --> 00:25:05.437
No. The sooner we find the humans,
the sooner I get rid of Mr Stinky Drool-Face,

198
00:25:05.530 --> 00:25:08.021
and the baby, too.

199
00:25:09.117 --> 00:25:11.786
You won't always have
Jumbo around to protect you.

200
00:25:11.869 --> 00:25:17.492
And when that day comes, I suggest you
watch your back, cos I'll be chewin' on it.

201
00:25:17.583 --> 00:25:21.367
Über-tracker. Up front, where I can see you.

202
00:25:21.461 --> 00:25:23.039
Help me.

203
00:25:38.769 --> 00:25:42.469
You gotta make it stop.
I can't take it any more.

204
00:25:42.647 --> 00:25:46.775
- I've eaten things that complained less.
- He won't stop squirming.

205
00:25:46.860 --> 00:25:48.982
- Watch its head.
- Put it down.

206
00:25:49.070 --> 00:25:51.643
Jeez, "pick him up, put him down... "

207
00:25:51.948 --> 00:25:55.197
- Its nose is dry.
- That means something's wrong with it.

208
00:25:55.284 --> 00:25:58.285
- Someone should lick it. Just in case.
- I'll do it.

209
00:25:58.370 --> 00:26:00.825
- He's wearing one of those baby thingies.
- So?

210
00:26:00.914 --> 00:26:03.701
So if he poops, where does it go?

211
00:26:06.085 --> 00:26:10.083
- Humans are disgusting.
- OK, you. Check for poop.

212
00:26:10.172 --> 00:26:13.422
- Why am I the poop-checker?
- Returning him was your idea,

213
00:26:13.509 --> 00:26:16.960
you're small and insignificant,
and I'll pummel you if you don't.

214
00:26:17.054 --> 00:26:19.544
- Why else?
- Now, Sid.

215
00:26:26.187 --> 00:26:29.353
I mean, my goodness.
Look out. Coming through.

216
00:26:29.440 --> 00:26:32.310
- Watch out.
- Stop wavin' that thing around.

217
00:26:32.401 --> 00:26:35.152
I'm gonna slip.

218
00:26:38.573 --> 00:26:40.862
It's clean. Got ya!

219
00:26:43.077 --> 00:26:45.153
Will you cut it out?

220
00:26:46.998 --> 00:26:49.868
Do that again. He likes it.

221
00:26:51.960 --> 00:26:55.127
It's makin' me feel better too.

222
00:26:55.213 --> 00:26:57.372
Here, you hold it.

223
00:27:03.930 --> 00:27:05.673
Turn him towards me.

224
00:27:05.931 --> 00:27:08.173
Where is the baby?

225
00:27:09.184 --> 00:27:11.426
There he is.

226
00:27:11.520 --> 00:27:14.355
Where is the baby?

227
00:27:14.856 --> 00:27:18.059
There he is.

228
00:27:18.234 --> 00:27:20.690
Stop it. You're scarin' him.

229
00:27:24.824 --> 00:27:27.279
- I bet he's hungry.
- How about some milk?

230
00:27:27.368 --> 00:27:30.404
- I'd love some.
- Not you. The baby.

231
00:27:30.495 --> 00:27:33.117
I ain't exactly lactating right now, pal.

232
00:27:33.206 --> 00:27:35.958
- You're a little low on the food chain to...
- Enough.

233
00:27:36.042 --> 00:27:39.577
Enough, enough, enough.

234
00:27:42.089 --> 00:27:44.165
Food.

235
00:27:52.349 --> 00:27:54.056
I don't know, but I've been told

236
00:27:54.142 --> 00:27:56.265
I don't know, but I've been told

237
00:27:56.352 --> 00:28:00.519
End of the world be mighty cold

238
00:28:00.940 --> 00:28:03.431
Prepare for the Ice age!

239
00:28:03.525 --> 00:28:06.016
Protect the dodo way of life!

240
00:28:06.111 --> 00:28:10.405
Survival separates the dodos from the beasts!

241
00:28:11.491 --> 00:28:14.112
Protect the dodo way of life!

242
00:28:14.202 --> 00:28:16.443
Prepare for the Ice age!

243
00:28:16.537 --> 00:28:19.538
- Ice age?
- I've heard of these crackpots.

244
00:28:22.459 --> 00:28:24.997
- Intruders.
- Now, don't fall in.

245
00:28:25.087 --> 00:28:29.131
- If you do, you will definitely...
- Intruders. Intruder...

246
00:28:30.884 --> 00:28:32.793
<i>.. burn and die.</i>

247
00:28:33.928 --> 00:28:37.094
Can we have our melon back?
Junior's hungry and...

248
00:28:37.181 --> 00:28:40.466
No way. This is our private
stockpile for the Ice age.

249
00:28:40.642 --> 00:28:44.722
Sub arctic temperatures will force us
underground for a billion years.

250
00:28:44.813 --> 00:28:46.889
So you got three melons?

251
00:28:48.400 --> 00:28:52.444
If you weren't smart enough
to plan ahead, then doom on you.

252
00:28:52.528 --> 00:28:56.228
Doom on you. Doom on you. Doom on you.

253
00:28:56.323 --> 00:28:59.110
- Get away from me.
- Doom on you.

254
00:28:59.201 --> 00:29:01.490
Oh, no. No.

255
00:29:01.870 --> 00:29:05.488
Retrieve the melon.
Tae kwon dodos, attack.

256
00:29:17.134 --> 00:29:20.752
- The melon.
- The melon, the melon, the melon...

257
00:29:22.514 --> 00:29:24.839
There goes our last female.

258
00:29:32.356 --> 00:29:35.891
- Got it, got it, got it.
- Don't got it.

259
00:29:36.860 --> 00:29:39.351
The last melon.

260
00:31:06.066 --> 00:31:09.150
Sid. Now we gotta find more food.

261
00:31:12.489 --> 00:31:16.486
Right, more to the right. Right, right, right.

262
00:31:16.576 --> 00:31:20.241
- Look at that. Dinner and a show.
- Left, left, left.

263
00:31:26.168 --> 00:31:30.212
Now to find a meal
befitting a conquering hero.

264
00:31:32.757 --> 00:31:36.126
What ho? A foe? Come on,
come on. You want a piece of me?

265
00:31:39.764 --> 00:31:41.839
Spoils worthy of such a noble...

266
00:31:50.982 --> 00:31:53.058
Bedtime, squirt.

267
00:32:02.743 --> 00:32:04.652
The triumphant return.

268
00:32:04.745 --> 00:32:07.615
Huh? Oh, that.

269
00:32:08.707 --> 00:32:13.083
I'm so full. How about a good-night
kiss for your big buddy, Sid?

270
00:32:13.836 --> 00:32:16.920
- He's asleep.
- I was talking to you.

271
00:32:17.798 --> 00:32:19.921
Fine, I'll tuck myself in.

272
00:32:26.264 --> 00:32:29.384
All right, good night.

273
00:32:51.912 --> 00:32:54.071
Will you stop it?

274
00:32:54.415 --> 00:32:57.202
All right, all right. I was trying to relax.

275
00:33:02.881 --> 00:33:04.957
Oy.

276
00:33:53.135 --> 00:33:56.468
- What the...?
- Slice me. It'll be the last thing you ever do.

277
00:33:56.555 --> 00:34:00.172
- I'm workin' here, you waste of fur.
- Frustrated, Diego?

278
00:34:00.266 --> 00:34:03.302
Tracking down helpless infants
too difficult for you?

279
00:34:03.394 --> 00:34:07.474
- What are you two doin' here?
- Soto's getting tired of waiting.

280
00:34:07.565 --> 00:34:12.855
Yeah, he said "Come back with the baby,
or don't come back at all. "

281
00:34:14.404 --> 00:34:16.729
I have a message for Soto.

282
00:34:16.823 --> 00:34:19.314
Tell him I'm bringing the baby.

283
00:34:20.535 --> 00:34:22.776
And tell him I'm bringing...

284
00:34:23.371 --> 00:34:25.446
a mammoth.

285
00:34:25.539 --> 00:34:28.208
- A mammoth?
- Mammoths never travel alone.

286
00:34:28.834 --> 00:34:32.416
This one does,
and I'm leading him to Half Peak.

287
00:34:33.963 --> 00:34:36.205
Look at all that meat. Let's get him.

288
00:34:36.299 --> 00:34:40.546
Not yet. We'll need the whole pack
to bring this mammoth down.

289
00:34:40.636 --> 00:34:42.712
Get everyone ready.

290
00:34:43.389 --> 00:34:45.465
Now.

291
00:35:08.620 --> 00:35:11.786
- Where's the baby?
- You lost it?

292
00:35:13.374 --> 00:35:14.572
Sid.

293
00:35:15.460 --> 00:35:19.160
It's so ugly. Positively adorable.

294
00:35:19.255 --> 00:35:23.122
Hello, pumpkin. Hello, little baldy bean.

295
00:35:23.383 --> 00:35:27.250
- Where'd you find it?
- The poor kid, all alone in the wild.

296
00:35:27.387 --> 00:35:29.593
Sabres were closing in on him.

297
00:35:29.681 --> 00:35:32.681
- So I just snatched him.
- So brave.

298
00:35:32.767 --> 00:35:37.559
Yeah, well, he needed me,
and I only wish I had one of my own, too.

299
00:35:37.646 --> 00:35:41.810
Really? I find that attractive in a male.

300
00:35:41.900 --> 00:35:45.518
Alas. Who wouldn't want
a family, I always say.

301
00:35:46.112 --> 00:35:49.813
- Where've you been hiding?
- Yeah, well, you know...

302
00:35:53.286 --> 00:35:57.069
Cute kid, huh? So, as I was saying, ladies...

303
00:35:59.249 --> 00:36:01.822
Hey. Hi, Manny.

304
00:36:02.377 --> 00:36:04.785
What's the matter with you?

305
00:36:05.088 --> 00:36:09.465
Excuse me, ladies. You just keep
marinating and I'll be right back.

306
00:36:11.886 --> 00:36:13.962
Sexy.

307
00:36:14.555 --> 00:36:17.758
He's not much to look at,
but it's so hard to find a family guy.

308
00:36:17.850 --> 00:36:21.301
Tell me about it.
All the sensitive ones get eaten.

309
00:36:21.895 --> 00:36:25.477
No, no, no. Manny, please,
I'm begging you. I need him.

310
00:36:25.565 --> 00:36:29.147
- A good-lookin' guy like you?
- You say that, but you don't mean it.

311
00:36:29.235 --> 00:36:33.731
No, seriously. Look at you.
Those ladies, they don't stand a chance.

312
00:36:33.822 --> 00:36:37.321
- You have a cruel sense of humour.
- Don't let me cramp your style.

313
00:36:37.409 --> 00:36:40.445
- Thanks, Manny. You're a pal.
- Without Pinky.

314
00:36:40.537 --> 00:36:42.862
Manny, I need him.

315
00:36:46.459 --> 00:36:49.495
So, ladies, where were we?

316
00:36:49.795 --> 00:36:52.500
- Carl.
- Easy, Frank.

317
00:36:55.175 --> 00:36:59.504
Pretty tail walks by, suddenly he moves
like a cheetah. And that tiger...

318
00:36:59.596 --> 00:37:03.427
Yeah, Mr Great Tracker.
Can't even find a sloth.

319
00:37:03.516 --> 00:37:07.383
What am I? The wet nurse?
What are you lookin' at, bone bag?

320
00:37:09.647 --> 00:37:13.347
Look at you. You're gonna
grow into a great predator.

321
00:37:13.775 --> 00:37:18.152
I don't think so. What have you got?
You got a little patch of fur.

322
00:37:18.238 --> 00:37:20.775
No fangs, no claws.

323
00:37:20.865 --> 00:37:24.234
You're folds of skin wrapped in mush.

324
00:37:24.619 --> 00:37:27.323
What's so threatening about you?

325
00:37:32.542 --> 00:37:35.460
Does this look like
a petting zoo to you? Huh?

326
00:37:38.339 --> 00:37:41.957
OK. All right, wise guy.
You just earned a time-out.

327
00:37:44.929 --> 00:37:47.882
You think that's funny? How about this?

328
00:37:50.017 --> 00:37:52.804
You'll be a little snack for the owls.

329
00:37:54.521 --> 00:37:57.687
You're a brave little squirt, I'll give you that.

330
00:38:03.779 --> 00:38:08.405
Thank goodness. Thank goodness.
No. A tiger.

331
00:38:08.492 --> 00:38:11.029
Help. Help.

332
00:38:11.161 --> 00:38:13.319
- Where's the baby?
- Manfred has him.

333
00:38:13.413 --> 00:38:17.624
Just put me in your mouth.
Come on. Hurry up. He got me.

334
00:38:18.584 --> 00:38:19.615
Help.

335
00:38:19.710 --> 00:38:22.283
- Get away from me.
- It went this way.

336
00:38:23.088 --> 00:38:25.377
Over here.

337
00:38:33.056 --> 00:38:35.593
Carl. The tiger beat us to him.

338
00:38:37.059 --> 00:38:39.633
Wait a minute.

339
00:38:44.608 --> 00:38:47.099
He's dead all right.

340
00:38:47.194 --> 00:38:49.316
Carnivores have all the fun.

341
00:38:51.864 --> 00:38:56.609
Gosh, I hate breaking their hearts
like that. But you know how it is.

342
00:38:57.411 --> 00:39:00.116
All right, thanks. You can put me down now.

343
00:39:00.706 --> 00:39:02.864
Manny. Manny.

344
00:39:03.250 --> 00:39:07.164
Guys, I thought we were in a hurry.
And Diego, spit that out.

345
00:39:07.253 --> 00:39:10.338
You don't know where it's been.

346
00:39:10.423 --> 00:39:14.171
Boy. For a second there,
I thought you were gonna eat me.

347
00:39:14.260 --> 00:39:17.379
- I don't eat junk food.
- Thought you were gonna...

348
00:39:17.471 --> 00:39:19.878
I thought you were gonna... Were you?

349
00:39:22.684 --> 00:39:27.642
Come on, wait up. Wait up. Come on,
come on. Can you wait a second, please?

350
00:39:27.730 --> 00:39:29.806
Fellas.

351
00:39:31.067 --> 00:39:33.143
Thanks for waiting.

352
00:39:33.235 --> 00:39:35.940
Three, two, one...

353
00:39:38.866 --> 00:39:40.941
Sure is faithful.

354
00:39:55.798 --> 00:39:57.956
- Don't make me reach back.
- He started it.

355
00:39:58.050 --> 00:40:01.299
I don't care who started it. I'll finish it.

356
00:40:34.082 --> 00:40:36.953
Modern architecture. It'll never last.

357
00:40:51.431 --> 00:40:53.471
Hiya, Manny.

358
00:40:55.393 --> 00:40:57.635
Hi, Diego.

359
00:41:04.527 --> 00:41:06.603
Hey, Sid.

360
00:41:06.987 --> 00:41:10.735
- You're lost.
- No. I know exactly where we are.

361
00:41:10.824 --> 00:41:13.149
Ask him directions.

362
00:41:13.243 --> 00:41:15.912
- I don't need directions.
- Fine, I'll ask him.

363
00:41:15.995 --> 00:41:19.115
Buddy. You see any humans go by here?

364
00:41:22.251 --> 00:41:25.252
I love this game. I love this game. OK, OK.

365
00:41:25.337 --> 00:41:29.798
Three words. First word.
Stomp. No, no. Stamp, stamp.

366
00:41:29.883 --> 00:41:32.041
Let me try. Pack.

367
00:41:32.219 --> 00:41:36.382
Good one, Manny.
Pack of long teeth and claws.

368
00:41:37.932 --> 00:41:39.971
Pack of wolves? Pack of...

369
00:41:40.059 --> 00:41:42.764
Pack of bears? Pack of fleas?

370
00:41:42.853 --> 00:41:44.929
Pack of whiskers? Pack of noses?

371
00:41:45.314 --> 00:41:47.602
- Pachyderm?
- Pack of lies.

372
00:41:47.691 --> 00:41:50.645
Pack of troubles. Pack a wallop.
Pack of birds.

373
00:41:50.902 --> 00:41:52.978
Pack of flying fish.

374
00:42:42.366 --> 00:42:44.654
Great news. I found a short cut.

375
00:42:47.579 --> 00:42:51.623
- What do you mean, short cut?
- I mean faster than the long way around.

376
00:42:51.916 --> 00:42:53.873
I know what a short cut is.

377
00:42:53.959 --> 00:42:59.250
Either we beat the humans to Glacier Pass
or we take the long way and miss 'em.

378
00:42:59.464 --> 00:43:03.082
Through there? What do you take me for?

379
00:43:03.176 --> 00:43:06.627
This time tomorrow,
you could be a free mammoth.

380
00:43:07.055 --> 00:43:09.724
Or a nanny. I never get tired of peek-a-boo.

381
00:43:09.807 --> 00:43:12.724
Guys. Guys. Check this out.

382
00:43:15.062 --> 00:43:17.600
Sid, the tiger found a short cut.

383
00:43:19.733 --> 00:43:21.809
No, thanks. I choose life.

384
00:43:21.902 --> 00:43:24.523
Then I suggest you take the short cut.

385
00:43:24.654 --> 00:43:28.486
- Are you threatening me?
- Move, sloth!

386
00:43:33.495 --> 00:43:35.951
Way to go, tiger.

387
00:43:36.039 --> 00:43:38.530
Quick. Get inside.

388
00:44:01.229 --> 00:44:03.898
OK, I vote short cut.

389
00:44:18.495 --> 00:44:22.159
Guys, stick together.
It's easy to get lost in here.

390
00:44:37.762 --> 00:44:39.838
Guys?

391
00:44:57.155 --> 00:44:59.194
A fish.

392
00:45:41.528 --> 00:45:45.656
Will you keep up, please?
Hard enough to keep track of one baby.

393
00:46:30.907 --> 00:46:32.982
I gotcha.

394
00:46:49.632 --> 00:46:52.123
Captain, iceberg ahead.

395
00:46:58.557 --> 00:47:00.633
Oh, no.

396
00:47:51.939 --> 00:47:54.227
Yeah. Who's up for round two?

397
00:47:58.695 --> 00:48:00.771
Tell the kid to be more careful.

398
00:48:42.067 --> 00:48:44.938
Look, look. Tigers.

399
00:48:46.989 --> 00:48:51.734
No, it's OK, it's OK. Look, the tigers
are just playing tag with the antelope.

400
00:48:53.786 --> 00:48:58.282
- With their teeth.
- Come on, Sid, let's play tag.

401
00:48:58.374 --> 00:49:00.450
You're it.

402
00:49:01.627 --> 00:49:04.830
Sure. OK, OK, OK, where are the sloth’s?

403
00:49:04.922 --> 00:49:07.792
You never see any sloth’s.
Have you ever noticed?

404
00:49:07.883 --> 00:49:11.465
- Look, Manny, a mammoth.
- Somebody pinch me.

405
00:49:11.553 --> 00:49:14.755
Hey, hey, this fat one looks just like you.

406
00:49:15.640 --> 00:49:17.965
And he's got a family.

407
00:49:18.058 --> 00:49:21.427
And he's happy.
Look, he's playing with his kid.

408
00:49:21.520 --> 00:49:25.220
See? That's your problem.
That's what mammoths are supposed to do.

409
00:49:25.315 --> 00:49:28.067
- Sid...
- Find a she-mammoth, have baby mammoths...

410
00:49:28.151 --> 00:49:29.610
- Sid.
- What?

411
00:49:29.694 --> 00:49:31.770
- Shut up.
- But...

412
00:52:59.510 --> 00:53:01.798
Would you look at that.

413
00:53:01.887 --> 00:53:04.923
The tiger actually did it. There's Half Peak.

414
00:53:05.015 --> 00:53:07.719
Next stop, Glacier Pass.

415
00:53:08.101 --> 00:53:11.884
- How could I ever have doubted you?
- Did you hear that, little fella?

416
00:53:11.979 --> 00:53:14.055
You're almost home.

417
00:53:18.777 --> 00:53:21.315
- My feet are sweating.
- Do we need a newsflash

418
00:53:21.405 --> 00:53:24.773
- every time your body does something?
- Ignore him.

419
00:53:24.866 --> 00:53:28.069
Seriously. My feet are really hot.

420
00:53:33.791 --> 00:53:36.116
Tell me that was your stomach.

421
00:53:36.210 --> 00:53:38.416
I'm sure it was just thunder.

422
00:53:38.712 --> 00:53:41.629
From underground?

423
00:54:01.900 --> 00:54:04.058
Come on, keep up with me.

424
00:54:04.152 --> 00:54:06.939
I would if you were moving.

425
00:54:09.323 --> 00:54:12.490
- I wish I could jump like that.
- Wish granted.

426
00:54:16.872 --> 00:54:21.249
- Come on, move faster.
- Have you noticed the river of lava?

427
00:54:40.476 --> 00:54:42.552
Hold Pinky.

428
00:55:14.007 --> 00:55:16.165
Manny.

429
00:55:27.603 --> 00:55:32.311
Manny, Manny, Manny, you OK?
Come on, come on, say something. Anything.

430
00:55:34.692 --> 00:55:36.768
What? What? I can't hear you.

431
00:55:36.944 --> 00:55:39.186
You're standing on my trunk.

432
00:55:41.198 --> 00:55:44.649
- You're OK. You're OK.
- Why did you do that?

433
00:55:44.743 --> 00:55:47.495
You could have died, trying to save me.

434
00:55:47.913 --> 00:55:50.486
That's what you do in a herd.

435
00:55:50.582 --> 00:55:52.740
You look out for each other.

436
00:55:52.917 --> 00:55:55.206
Well, thanks.

437
00:55:57.380 --> 00:56:01.958
I don't know about you guys,
but we are the weirdest herd I've ever seen.

438
00:56:20.317 --> 00:56:23.353
I can't wait to get
my claws in that mammoth.

439
00:56:23.445 --> 00:56:27.229
No one touches the mammoth
until I get that baby.

440
00:56:30.618 --> 00:56:33.287
First, I'll slice its hind quarters into sections.

441
00:56:33.371 --> 00:56:37.582
- I'll put the white meat in one pile and...
- Knock it off. I'm starving.

442
00:56:37.666 --> 00:56:41.366
Next, the shoulders. Occasionally
tough, but extremely juicy.

443
00:56:41.461 --> 00:56:44.664
- I told you to knock it off.
- Save your energy.

444
00:56:44.756 --> 00:56:47.757
Mammoths don't go down easy.

445
00:56:48.009 --> 00:56:50.334
There's only one way to do it.

446
00:56:50.470 --> 00:56:53.007
First, you have to force it into a corner.

447
00:56:53.848 --> 00:56:57.679
Cut off its retreat.
And when you three have it trapped,

448
00:56:57.935 --> 00:57:00.057
I'll go for the throat.

449
00:57:10.029 --> 00:57:12.816
Guys, we gotta get this kid outta the wind.

450
00:57:17.077 --> 00:57:19.366
- How much further?
- Three miles.

451
00:57:19.454 --> 00:57:22.823
I'm beat. We'll get there in the morning.

452
00:57:25.960 --> 00:57:29.625
- What are you doin'?
- I'm putting sloth’s on the map.

453
00:57:32.508 --> 00:57:35.674
Why don't you make it realistic
and draw him lying down?

454
00:57:35.761 --> 00:57:37.837
And make him rounder.

455
00:57:40.390 --> 00:57:44.174
- Perfect.
- I forgot how to laugh.

456
00:57:51.567 --> 00:57:53.643
I'm a genius.

457
00:57:57.322 --> 00:58:02.280
From now on you'll have to
refer to me as Sid, Lord of the Flame.

458
00:58:02.493 --> 00:58:05.909
Lord of the Flame, your tail's on fire.

459
00:58:13.920 --> 00:58:17.918
Thank you. From now on,
I'm gonna call you Diego.

460
00:58:18.007 --> 00:58:20.332
Lord of Touch Me and You're Dead.

461
00:58:20.426 --> 00:58:23.546
I'm just kiddin', you little knucklehead.

462
00:58:24.096 --> 00:58:26.302
Lovebirds.

463
00:58:26.390 --> 00:58:28.466
Look at this.

464
00:58:32.395 --> 00:58:34.471
I don't believe it.

465
00:58:47.910 --> 00:58:52.904
Come here, you little biped.
Come here, you little wormy-worm.

466
00:58:52.998 --> 00:58:55.204
Come to Uncle Sid.

467
00:58:55.291 --> 00:58:58.327
No, no, no, no, no, no. This way. This way.

468
00:58:59.420 --> 00:59:02.125
No, no, no. No, go to him.

469
00:59:03.257 --> 00:59:05.333
Go to him.

470
00:59:07.719 --> 00:59:09.000
OK.

471
00:59:10.388 --> 00:59:14.137
Good job. Keep practisin'.

472
00:59:17.061 --> 00:59:20.227
Look at that. Our little guy is growing up.

473
00:59:22.524 --> 00:59:25.560
All right, come on. Sleep time, lumpy.

474
00:59:31.199 --> 00:59:33.275
Look at that big pushover.

475
00:59:34.869 --> 00:59:39.198
You know, Diego, I've never had
a friend who would risk his life for me.

476
00:59:39.623 --> 00:59:43.952
Yeah, Manny's... he's a good guy.

477
00:59:44.378 --> 00:59:46.453
Yeah, he is.

478
00:59:47.172 --> 00:59:49.579
Well, good night.

479
01:00:21.661 --> 01:00:27.248
Let's get you all cleaned up. What's your
daddy gonna say if you go back all stinky?

480
01:00:28.084 --> 01:00:32.164
Let me just clean that up.
That looks good. A little bit here.

481
01:00:32.254 --> 01:00:36.086
- You clean up nice, little fella.
- I think he's starting to look like me.

482
01:00:36.175 --> 01:00:38.250
Diego, what do you think?

483
01:00:39.970 --> 01:00:42.342
- Maybe we shouldn't do this.
- Why not?

484
01:00:42.430 --> 01:00:46.214
If we save him, he'll be a hunter.
And who do you think he'll hunt?

485
01:00:46.434 --> 01:00:48.841
Maybe because we save him,
he won't hunt us.

486
01:00:48.936 --> 01:00:53.514
Yeah, and maybe he'll grow fur and
a long skinny neck and call you Mama.

487
01:00:54.066 --> 01:00:59.440
- What's your problem?
- Nothing. Let's go. I'm freezing my tail off.

488
01:01:18.755 --> 01:01:20.913
Diego. You frozen back there?

489
01:01:25.177 --> 01:01:27.170
- Get down.
- What?

490
01:01:27.263 --> 01:01:29.551
- Get down and follow me.
- What's goin' on?

491
01:01:29.640 --> 01:01:34.681
At the bottom of Half Peak,
there's an ambush waiting for you.

492
01:01:34.770 --> 01:01:37.058
- What?
- What do you mean, "ambush"?

493
01:01:39.274 --> 01:01:41.432
- You set us up.
- It was my job.

494
01:01:41.526 --> 01:01:45.108
- I was to get the baby, but then...
- You brought us home for dinner.

495
01:01:45.196 --> 01:01:47.983
- That's it. You're out of the herd.
- I'm sorry.

496
01:01:48.073 --> 01:01:50.149
No, you're not. Not yet.

497
01:01:50.367 --> 01:01:54.032
- Listen, I can help you.
- Stay close, Sid. We can fight our way out.

498
01:01:54.204 --> 01:01:57.370
You can't. The pack's too strong.
You have to trust me.

499
01:01:57.457 --> 01:02:00.742
Trust you? Why in the world
would we trust you?

500
01:02:00.835 --> 01:02:02.911
Because I'm your only chance.

501
01:02:16.557 --> 01:02:18.597
Hello, ladies.

502
01:02:19.477 --> 01:02:24.933
- Look who decided to show up.
- Diego, I was beginning to worry about you.

503
01:02:25.024 --> 01:02:31.275
No need to worry. In about two minutes
you'll be satisfying your taste for revenge.

504
01:02:31.404 --> 01:02:33.112
Very nice.

505
01:02:33.490 --> 01:02:36.574
I see the sloth. And he's got the baby.

506
01:02:36.659 --> 01:02:42.033
Don't give away your positions until you
see the mammoth. He's the one to surprise.

507
01:02:43.248 --> 01:02:45.739
You want to maul something, don't you?

508
01:02:45.834 --> 01:02:49.333
- I wanna maul.
- Then what are you waiting for?

509
01:02:52.215 --> 01:02:55.002
No, I said wait for the mammoth.

510
01:03:17.029 --> 01:03:20.196
Backscratcher. Eat my powder!

511
01:03:35.796 --> 01:03:37.872
Loop-de-loop.

512
01:03:38.882 --> 01:03:41.041
Slalom! Slalom, baby!

513
01:04:06.741 --> 01:04:10.573
Sorry, fellas. He got a little frostbite.

514
01:04:12.204 --> 01:04:14.280
Get him.

515
01:04:17.292 --> 01:04:19.368
Surprise!

516
01:04:24.299 --> 01:04:28.960
OK, follow me. We'll pick up Sid
and get outta here while we can.

517
01:04:29.053 --> 01:04:33.002
Come on, Diego,
let's bring this mammoth down.

518
01:04:45.359 --> 01:04:47.684
There he is.

519
01:04:49.738 --> 01:04:52.194
That's right. Where's the baby?

520
01:04:56.077 --> 01:04:59.363
Survival of the fittest.

521
01:04:59.456 --> 01:05:02.290
I don't think so. Yeah.

522
01:05:13.510 --> 01:05:18.006
- What are you doing?
- Leave the mammoth alone.

523
01:05:20.933 --> 01:05:23.969
Fine. I'll take you down first.

524
01:06:39.922 --> 01:06:41.998
We did it.

525
01:06:54.727 --> 01:06:57.396
We were some team, huh?

526
01:06:58.147 --> 01:07:01.562
Were? Come on, we're still a team.

527
01:07:02.025 --> 01:07:04.598
I'm sorry I set you up.

528
01:07:05.111 --> 01:07:07.946
You know me -
I'm too lazy to hold a grudge.

529
01:07:11.284 --> 01:07:13.359
Knock it off, squirt.

530
01:07:14.328 --> 01:07:16.367
You gotta be strong.

531
01:07:16.705 --> 01:07:20.038
You have to take care of Manfred and Sid.

532
01:07:21.042 --> 01:07:23.082
Especially Sid.

533
01:07:23.169 --> 01:07:27.036
Come on, you can lick this. You're a tiger.

534
01:07:27.131 --> 01:07:30.251
Look, I'll carry you.
Come on, what do you say?

535
01:07:30.343 --> 01:07:32.631
Come on, Diego, come on.

536
01:07:32.720 --> 01:07:34.878
Tell him he's going to be OK, Manny.

537
01:07:36.431 --> 01:07:40.096
Listen, you have to leave me here.

538
01:07:40.185 --> 01:07:44.396
If those humans get through the pass,
you'll never catch them.

539
01:07:45.023 --> 01:07:48.107
You didn't have to do that.

540
01:07:48.192 --> 01:07:50.944
That's what you do in a herd.

541
01:11:06.706 --> 01:11:08.782
Don't forget about us.

542
01:11:08.874 --> 01:11:10.950
OK?

543
01:11:13.170 --> 01:11:15.922
We won't forget about you.

544
01:11:55.542 --> 01:11:58.163
Goodbye.

545
01:11:58.253 --> 01:12:00.708
Goodbye. Goodbye.

546
01:12:00.797 --> 01:12:03.122
- Sid...
- Bye.

547
01:12:04.550 --> 01:12:06.626
Bye.

548
01:12:09.388 --> 01:12:11.795
That's right. Where's the baby?

549
01:12:11.932 --> 01:12:14.470
Come on, Sid, let's head south.

550
01:12:32.450 --> 01:12:34.443
Bye.

551
01:12:35.578 --> 01:12:39.077
Save your breath, Sid.
You know humans can't talk.

552
01:12:39.582 --> 01:12:41.658
Diego? You're OK.

553
01:12:41.792 --> 01:12:44.995
- Nine lives, baby.
- You're OK.

554
01:12:45.087 --> 01:12:47.163
You're OK.

555
01:12:47.839 --> 01:12:49.915
I could kiss ya.

556
01:12:51.635 --> 01:12:53.841
Welcome back, partner. Wanna lift?

557
01:12:53.928 --> 01:12:56.929
No thanks. I gotta save
whatever dignity I've got left.

558
01:12:57.098 --> 01:13:01.558
You're hanging out with us. Dignity's
got nothing to do with it. I'll take that lift.

559
01:13:01.644 --> 01:13:04.181
- Yeah, climb aboard.
- Pick me up, buddy.

560
01:13:04.730 --> 01:13:08.229
Mush. Or not mush. Either way.

561
01:13:11.986 --> 01:13:14.607
This is gonna be the best migration ever.

562
01:13:14.697 --> 01:13:19.608
I'll show you my favourite watering holes.
I turn brown when the fungus in my fur dries.

563
01:13:19.702 --> 01:13:23.485
- Attractive.
- This whole Ice age thing is getting old.

564
01:13:23.580 --> 01:13:26.913
You know what I could go for?
Global warming.

565
01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:30.084
- Keep dreamin'.
- No, really...

566
01:14:00.985 --> 01:14:20.185
