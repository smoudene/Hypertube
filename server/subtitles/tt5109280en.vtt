3
00:01:04.898 --> 00:01:06.650
I know what you're thinking.

4
00:01:07.442 --> 00:01:09.486
A lone rider.

5
00:01:09.945 --> 00:01:11.822
A dystopian world.

6
00:01:11.989 --> 00:01:14.533
A land that's gone to waste.

7
00:01:15.242 --> 00:01:18.036
How did this world
getso broken?

8
00:01:19.371 --> 00:01:22.833
Well, that all began
500 years ago.

9
00:01:24.793 --> 00:01:26.545
Kumandra.

10
00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:30.382
This is what we used to be.

11
00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:32.009
When our land was whole,

12
00:01:32.092 --> 00:01:34.845
and we lived harmoniously
alongside...

13
00:01:36.054 --> 00:01:37.139
dragons.

14
00:01:37.306 --> 00:01:38.640
Magical creatures
who brought us

15
00:01:38.724 --> 00:01:42.311
waterand rain and peace.

16
00:01:43.562 --> 00:01:46.190
It was paradise.

17
00:01:46.356 --> 00:01:48.901
But then, the Druun came.

18
00:01:51.278 --> 00:01:54.740
A mindless plague
that spread like wildfire,

19
00:01:54.907 --> 00:01:56.533
multiplying
as they consumed life

20
00:01:56.617 --> 00:02:00.037
and turned everyone
they touched into stone.

21
00:02:01.121 --> 00:02:03.457
The dragons fought for us
the best they could,

22
00:02:05.417 --> 00:02:07.669
but it wasn't enough.

23
00:02:09.296 --> 00:02:11.131
That's when
the Mighty Sisudatu,

24
00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:12.674
the last dragon,

25
00:02:12.758 --> 00:02:15.677
concentrated all her magic
into a gem and...

26
00:02:21.266 --> 00:02:23.560
...blasted the Druun away.

27
00:02:24.603 --> 00:02:26.939
Everyone that was turned
to stone came back.

28
00:02:27.898 --> 00:02:30.817
Except the dragons.

29
00:02:34.112 --> 00:02:36.740
All that was left of Sisu
was her gem.

30
00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:40.077
It should have been
this big inspirational moment,

31
00:02:40.244 --> 00:02:42.579
where humanity united
over her sacrifice.

32
00:02:42.746 --> 00:02:45.791
But instead,
people being people,

33
00:02:45.958 --> 00:02:47.835
they all fought to possess

34
00:02:47.918 --> 00:02:50.212
the last remnant
of dragon magic.

35
00:02:51.421 --> 00:02:54.299
Borders were drawn,
Kumandra divided.

36
00:02:55.008 --> 00:02:58.136
We all became enemies,
and the gem had to be hidden.

37
00:02:59.304 --> 00:03:01.515
But that's not how
the world broke.

38
00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:05.102
That didn't truly happen
until 500 years later,

39
00:03:05.727 --> 00:03:07.312
when I came into the story.

40
00:03:50.063 --> 00:03:51.064
Hmm.

41
00:04:06.288 --> 00:04:07.289
Huh.

42
00:04:07.581 --> 00:04:09.333
Looks like someone's trying
to be clever.

43
00:04:12.628 --> 00:04:13.754
All right, Tuk Tuk,

44
00:04:13.837 --> 00:04:15.589
let's show 'em
what clever really looks like.

45
00:04:26.058 --> 00:04:27.142
Tuk Tuk!

46
00:04:27.851 --> 00:04:28.894
Come on!

47
00:04:29.019 --> 00:04:30.020
Focus!

48
00:04:32.064 --> 00:04:33.065
Thank you.

49
00:04:37.945 --> 00:04:40.405
Hey, bud, that was awesome.
Give me some shell.

50
00:04:42.241 --> 00:04:43.742
I got ya.

51
00:05:28.871 --> 00:05:29.872
Whoa.

52
00:05:34.042 --> 00:05:35.127
Wait a second.

53
00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:40.257
This feels too easy.

54
00:05:42.676 --> 00:05:44.344
Chief Benja.

55
00:05:44.887 --> 00:05:47.431
I know it's your job
to try and stop me,

56
00:05:47.973 --> 00:05:49.141
but you won't.

57
00:05:49.308 --> 00:05:51.977
Don't mistake spirit
for skill, young one.

58
00:05:52.144 --> 00:05:53.687
I promise
you will not set foot

59
00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:55.731
on the Dragon Gem's
inner circle.

60
00:05:56.064 --> 00:05:57.316
Not even a toe.

61
00:05:57.649 --> 00:05:59.610
You might wanna take out
that blade.

62
00:05:59.693 --> 00:06:00.694
You're gonna need it.

63
00:06:01.028 --> 00:06:02.029
Not today.

64
00:06:37.606 --> 00:06:38.607
Boop.

65
00:06:39.024 --> 00:06:42.819
Like I said, not one foot
on the inner circle.

66
00:06:43.654 --> 00:06:45.155
You lost, Raya.

67
00:06:45.739 --> 00:06:46.740
Did I?

68
00:06:50.035 --> 00:06:51.328
Raya...

69
00:06:51.495 --> 00:06:53.455
I probably should have said
two feet.

70
00:06:53.622 --> 00:06:56.792
Hey, don't beat yourself up
too much, Chief Benja.

71
00:06:56.959 --> 00:06:58.627
You gave it your best.

72
00:06:58.752 --> 00:07:00.420
I won't.

73
00:07:00.504 --> 00:07:03.090
And it's either "Father"
or "Ba" to you.

74
00:07:04.049 --> 00:07:07.636
You did good, dewdrop.
You passed the test.

75
00:07:10.848 --> 00:07:12.307
Wow.

76
00:07:13.308 --> 00:07:15.894
The spirit of Sisu.

77
00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:27.364
For generations, our family
has sworn to protect the gem.

78
00:07:28.323 --> 00:07:31.994
Today, you will join
that legacy.

79
00:07:32.995 --> 00:07:37.583
Raya, Princess of Heart,
my daughter,

80
00:07:38.166 --> 00:07:41.295
you are now
a Guardian of the Dragon Gem.

81
00:08:25.339 --> 00:08:26.757
Whoa. Ah...

82
00:08:27.925 --> 00:08:29.259
Well, someone's excited.

83
00:08:29.426 --> 00:08:30.677
Well, yeah!

84
00:08:30.844 --> 00:08:33.055
I mean, anyone hoping
to steal the Dragon Gem

85
00:08:33.138 --> 00:08:34.640
now has to face the fury

86
00:08:34.806 --> 00:08:38.268
of the two baddest blades
in all the lands.

87
00:08:38.352 --> 00:08:40.854
I'm glad
you feel prepared, dewdrop,

88
00:08:41.021 --> 00:08:43.565
because I have something
important to tell you.

89
00:08:43.732 --> 00:08:46.693
The other lands, they're on
their way here, as we speak.

90
00:08:46.860 --> 00:08:48.362
They are? Uh...

91
00:08:48.779 --> 00:08:49.905
Okay.

92
00:08:50.072 --> 00:08:52.574
Okay, no, we can do this.
I'm ready.

93
00:08:52.741 --> 00:08:54.785
I know exactly
how we'll stop them.

94
00:08:54.952 --> 00:08:57.788
Really? Tell me what you know
about the other lands.

95
00:08:58.121 --> 00:08:59.748
First... Tail.

96
00:08:59.915 --> 00:09:02.751
A sweltering desert
with sneaky mercenaries

97
00:09:02.835 --> 00:09:04.711
who fight dirty.

98
00:09:04.878 --> 00:09:06.171
Second, Talon.

99
00:09:06.338 --> 00:09:08.674
A floating market famous
for fast deals

100
00:09:08.757 --> 00:09:10.551
and fighters
with even faster hands.

101
00:09:12.135 --> 00:09:13.554
Third, Spine.

102
00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:15.514
A frigid bamboo forest

103
00:09:15.681 --> 00:09:18.559
guarded by
exceptionally large warriors,

104
00:09:18.642 --> 00:09:20.853
and their giant axes.

105
00:09:22.020 --> 00:09:25.232
Fourth, Fang.
Our fiercest enemy.

106
00:09:25.399 --> 00:09:27.568
A nation protected
by angry assassins,

107
00:09:27.651 --> 00:09:29.778
and their even angrier cats.

108
00:09:32.781 --> 00:09:33.782
Okay,

109
00:09:33.866 --> 00:09:37.202
so we're gonna need some
crossbows and catapults and...

110
00:09:37.286 --> 00:09:40.372
Ooh! What about
flaming catapults?

111
00:09:40.539 --> 00:09:44.626
Or, how about
shrimp paste from Tail.

112
00:09:44.793 --> 00:09:48.088
lemongrass from Talon,
bamboo shoots from Spine,

113
00:09:48.255 --> 00:09:51.508
chilis from Fang
and palm sugar from Heart?

114
00:09:51.675 --> 00:09:53.051
We'll poison them?

115
00:09:53.218 --> 00:09:55.721
No, we're not going
to poison them

116
00:09:55.804 --> 00:09:57.389
and we're not going
to fight them.

117
00:09:57.556 --> 00:09:59.183
We're going to share a meal
with them.

118
00:09:59.349 --> 00:10:01.643
- Wait, what?
- I invited them.

119
00:10:01.810 --> 00:10:02.978
But they're our enemies.

120
00:10:03.145 --> 00:10:04.396
They're only our enemies

121
00:10:04.563 --> 00:10:06.440
because they think
the Dragon Gem

122
00:10:06.523 --> 00:10:08.192
magically brings
us prosperity.

123
00:10:08.358 --> 00:10:10.527
That's ridiculous.
It doesn't do that.

124
00:10:10.694 --> 00:10:12.237
They assume it does,

125
00:10:12.321 --> 00:10:14.573
just like we assume things
about them.

126
00:10:15.490 --> 00:10:17.618
Raya, there's a reason why
each land

127
00:10:17.701 --> 00:10:20.245
is named after
a part of the dragon.

128
00:10:20.412 --> 00:10:23.999
We were once unified.
Harmoniously as one.

129
00:10:24.082 --> 00:10:25.083
Kumandra.

130
00:10:25.459 --> 00:10:27.336
That's ancient history, Ba.

131
00:10:27.586 --> 00:10:29.546
But it doesn't have to be.

132
00:10:29.713 --> 00:10:31.465
Listen, if we don't stop

133
00:10:31.548 --> 00:10:33.759
and learn to trust
one another again,

134
00:10:33.926 --> 00:10:35.052
it's only a matter of time

135
00:10:35.135 --> 00:10:37.179
before we tear
each other apart.

136
00:10:37.804 --> 00:10:41.225
This isn't the world
I want you to live in.

137
00:10:43.185 --> 00:10:46.563
I believe that
we can be Kumandra again.

138
00:10:46.730 --> 00:10:49.441
But someone has to take
the first step.

139
00:10:53.028 --> 00:10:54.196
Trust me.

140
00:11:14.633 --> 00:11:16.426
Things look
a little tense, Ba.

141
00:11:16.593 --> 00:11:18.679
Don't worry,
I'm gonna open with a joke.

142
00:11:18.846 --> 00:11:19.972
Please don't.

143
00:11:20.138 --> 00:11:21.431
I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

144
00:11:22.975 --> 00:11:25.185
People of Tail, Talon,

145
00:11:25.269 --> 00:11:27.729
Spine, and Fang,

146
00:11:27.896 --> 00:11:29.773
welcome to Heart.

147
00:11:30.774 --> 00:11:33.318
For far too long,
we have been enemies,

148
00:11:33.402 --> 00:11:35.696
but today is a new day.

149
00:11:36.154 --> 00:11:39.741
Today, we can be Kumandra
once more.

150
00:11:41.368 --> 00:11:43.745
Nice speech, Chief Benja.

151
00:11:43.912 --> 00:11:45.539
But why'd you really
bring us here?

152
00:11:45.622 --> 00:11:46.623
Are you gonna rob us?

153
00:11:46.832 --> 00:11:48.292
Why would he need to rob us?

154
00:11:48.375 --> 00:11:50.627
The land of Heart
already has everything.

155
00:11:50.794 --> 00:11:53.130
Oh, it's easy to pontificate
on Kumandra

156
00:11:53.297 --> 00:11:55.174
when you hold the mightiest
weapon in all the lands.

157
00:11:56.341 --> 00:11:59.344
The gem's not a weapon.
It's a sacred relic.

158
00:11:59.511 --> 00:12:02.181
Kumandra!
Kumandra's a joke!

159
00:12:02.639 --> 00:12:03.932
He brought us all this way

160
00:12:04.016 --> 00:12:05.767
to talk about fairy tales.

161
00:12:05.934 --> 00:12:07.269
This is pointless!

162
00:12:15.152 --> 00:12:16.612
I have something to say.

163
00:12:21.491 --> 00:12:22.618
Who's hungry?

164
00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:26.121
Oh.

165
00:12:29.458 --> 00:12:30.876
Go ahead. It's all right.

166
00:12:36.006 --> 00:12:38.258
I'm Namaari, of Fang.

167
00:12:38.550 --> 00:12:41.470
Hi, Namaari. I'm Raya.

168
00:12:42.804 --> 00:12:43.889
Is that Sisu?

169
00:12:45.641 --> 00:12:47.392
Sorry, um, yeah,

170
00:12:47.476 --> 00:12:50.187
I might be a little bit
of a dragon nerd.

171
00:12:50.354 --> 00:12:53.440
Hey, I'm the one wearing
the Sisu fan necklace.

172
00:12:53.857 --> 00:12:55.025
Come on.

173
00:12:55.484 --> 00:12:56.610
Have you eaten yet?

174
00:13:04.034 --> 00:13:06.161
Seriously?

175
00:13:06.245 --> 00:13:08.080
Your mom actually said that?

176
00:13:08.622 --> 00:13:11.041
Awkward.
Okay, next question.

177
00:13:11.208 --> 00:13:13.293
Hand-to-hand or swords?

178
00:13:13.794 --> 00:13:16.004
- Blades all day.
- Right?

179
00:13:16.171 --> 00:13:18.423
Okay, dressy or casual?

180
00:13:18.590 --> 00:13:19.925
Only a monster would choose

181
00:13:20.008 --> 00:13:21.510
to wear this outfit
on the regular.

182
00:13:22.678 --> 00:13:24.429
Uh, rice or stew?

183
00:13:26.265 --> 00:13:28.100
I didn't think
that'd stump you.

184
00:13:28.267 --> 00:13:30.936
Uh... This is actually
one of the first times

185
00:13:31.019 --> 00:13:32.062
I've had rice in awhile.

186
00:13:32.938 --> 00:13:33.939
Really?

187
00:13:34.106 --> 00:13:36.775
Fang may look nice
on the outside,

188
00:13:36.942 --> 00:13:40.028
but we have some pretty
big holes on the inside.

189
00:13:40.404 --> 00:13:41.405
Oh.

190
00:13:41.738 --> 00:13:44.032
Sorry. Didn't mean
to bring it down.

191
00:13:44.199 --> 00:13:45.701
So, where were we?

192
00:13:45.868 --> 00:13:47.119
We both have single parents

193
00:13:47.202 --> 00:13:48.829
who are terrible
at telling jokes.

194
00:13:48.996 --> 00:13:50.581
We're both warrior women

195
00:13:50.664 --> 00:13:52.332
who despise uncomfortable
formal wear.

196
00:13:52.499 --> 00:13:53.959
And we're both Sisu superfans.

197
00:13:54.126 --> 00:13:55.252
Yeah.

198
00:13:55.919 --> 00:14:00.132
You know, Fang legend says
she's still out there.

199
00:14:00.299 --> 00:14:02.968
Sisu? You're kidding, right?

200
00:14:03.135 --> 00:14:04.928
Wanna see something?

201
00:14:05.012 --> 00:14:07.264
Are you supposed to have that?

202
00:14:07.431 --> 00:14:08.599
No.

203
00:14:08.765 --> 00:14:09.850
According to this,

204
00:14:10.809 --> 00:14:14.396
after the Mighty Sisu
blasted away all the Druun,

205
00:14:14.563 --> 00:14:17.566
she fell into the water
and floated downstream.

206
00:14:17.733 --> 00:14:20.903
Legends say she's now sleeping
at the river's end.

207
00:14:21.069 --> 00:14:24.031
But which river?
There's, like, hundreds.

208
00:14:24.114 --> 00:14:25.115
I don't know.

209
00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:28.619
But if we could find it,
could you imagine?

210
00:14:28.785 --> 00:14:30.871
A dragon back in the world.

211
00:14:31.455 --> 00:14:34.333
Things could be
so much better.

212
00:14:35.834 --> 00:14:36.835
Yeah.

213
00:14:37.711 --> 00:14:41.006
Maybe we really could be
Kumandra again.

214
00:14:46.178 --> 00:14:47.221
Here.

215
00:14:48.222 --> 00:14:49.223
Whoa.

216
00:14:49.306 --> 00:14:50.307
Really?

217
00:14:50.641 --> 00:14:53.268
From one dragon nerd
to another.

218
00:14:56.438 --> 00:14:57.439
Hmm.

219
00:15:00.651 --> 00:15:01.652
Hey.

220
00:15:01.735 --> 00:15:04.947
Come with me, dep la.
I wanna show you something.

221
00:15:26.635 --> 00:15:30.180
The spirit of Sisu.
I can feel it.

222
00:15:30.722 --> 00:15:31.890
It's the last bit
of dragon magic

223
00:15:31.974 --> 00:15:34.017
left in the whole world.

224
00:15:35.310 --> 00:15:37.938
I see why
Heart guards it so closely.

225
00:15:38.605 --> 00:15:42.651
Thank you, dep la.
You've been very helpful.

226
00:15:45.237 --> 00:15:48.282
In a different world, maybe
we could have been friends,

227
00:15:48.448 --> 00:15:50.534
but I have to do
what's right for Fang.

228
00:16:14.057 --> 00:16:17.936
Chief Virana, I'm so glad
Fang accepted our invitation.

229
00:16:25.485 --> 00:16:26.486
Huh?

230
00:16:29.114 --> 00:16:31.575
There is no way
you're taking Sisu's gem.

231
00:16:32.159 --> 00:16:34.912
Sorry. It's Fang's now.

232
00:16:53.597 --> 00:16:57.392
You will not set foot on
the Dragon Gem's inner circle.

233
00:16:57.476 --> 00:16:58.477
What's going on?

234
00:16:58.560 --> 00:16:59.645
What is this?

235
00:16:59.811 --> 00:17:01.063
Fang's
making a play for the gem!

236
00:17:01.230 --> 00:17:02.648
No! Spine should have the gem!

237
00:17:02.814 --> 00:17:04.149
Not if we get to it first!

238
00:17:04.316 --> 00:17:05.817
Our blades say different.

239
00:17:13.784 --> 00:17:14.910
Listen to me!

240
00:17:15.077 --> 00:17:16.411
We have a choice.

241
00:17:16.578 --> 00:17:18.956
We can tear each other apart,

242
00:17:19.122 --> 00:17:23.293
or we can come together
and build a better world.

243
00:17:24.211 --> 00:17:26.088
It's not too late.

244
00:17:26.255 --> 00:17:31.176
I still believe
we can be Kumandra again.

245
00:17:37.015 --> 00:17:38.016
Ba!

246
00:17:38.183 --> 00:17:39.560
Out of my way!

247
00:17:39.768 --> 00:17:41.144
The gem belongs to Spine!

248
00:17:41.520 --> 00:17:42.980
Give me the gem!

249
00:17:49.236 --> 00:17:51.446
No... No...

250
00:18:08.589 --> 00:18:09.590
Druun.

251
00:18:21.018 --> 00:18:22.311
There's still magic in them!

252
00:18:22.477 --> 00:18:23.687
- Get the pieces!
- No!

253
00:18:29.902 --> 00:18:31.987
Ba! Come on, we have to go!

254
00:18:39.912 --> 00:18:41.455
They're repelled by water.

255
00:18:41.622 --> 00:18:43.165
Hurry! Get to the river!

256
00:18:47.294 --> 00:18:49.171
Ba, get up! Come on!

257
00:18:49.338 --> 00:18:51.548
Please, we have
to keep moving.

258
00:18:51.673 --> 00:18:52.674
Get up!

259
00:18:56.512 --> 00:18:58.555
Ba! We don't have time!

260
00:19:03.435 --> 00:19:05.521
Stand up! I'll help...

261
00:19:05.687 --> 00:19:07.689
Raya, you have to listen.

262
00:19:07.773 --> 00:19:10.067
You are the Guardian
of the Dragon Gem.

263
00:19:10.234 --> 00:19:11.693
Ba, why are you saying this?

264
00:19:13.529 --> 00:19:16.073
There's still light in this.
There's still hope.

265
00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:18.575
No! We can make it together.

266
00:19:20.035 --> 00:19:21.828
You're okay.

267
00:19:21.995 --> 00:19:24.915
Raya.
Don't give up on them.

268
00:19:27.626 --> 00:19:30.003
I love you, my dewdrop.

269
00:19:30.170 --> 00:19:31.171
Ba?

270
00:19:31.338 --> 00:19:32.798
No!

271
00:19:52.109 --> 00:19:53.318
Ba!

272
00:19:59.575 --> 00:20:00.701
Ba.

273
00:21:33.335 --> 00:21:35.128
Please let this be it.

274
00:21:36.171 --> 00:21:37.881
Whoa!

275
00:21:37.965 --> 00:21:40.217
What are you doing,
you big fur bug?

276
00:21:40.425 --> 00:21:42.719
Hey, buddy, focus.

277
00:21:42.886 --> 00:21:44.847
Eyes forward, Tuk Tuk.

278
00:21:45.389 --> 00:21:46.723
Good boy.

279
00:21:47.474 --> 00:21:48.934
You're so easily distracted.

280
00:22:11.999 --> 00:22:13.750
You're getting a little
too big for this, bud.

281
00:22:26.096 --> 00:22:27.723
Six years of searching

282
00:22:27.806 --> 00:22:31.393
and we end up
at a literal shipwreck.

283
00:22:34.646 --> 00:22:36.565
That's not a bad sign, is it?

284
00:23:26.865 --> 00:23:28.367
Sisudatu...

285
00:23:29.284 --> 00:23:30.577
Um...

286
00:23:30.661 --> 00:23:32.329
I don't know
if you're listening.

287
00:23:33.080 --> 00:23:36.500
I've searched every river
to find you,

288
00:23:37.918 --> 00:23:40.963
and now I'm here
at the very last one.

289
00:23:43.924 --> 00:23:46.844
Look, there's not
a lot of us left,

290
00:23:48.303 --> 00:23:51.431
and we really...
We really need your help.

291
00:23:53.767 --> 00:23:55.727
If I can be honest,

292
00:23:56.478 --> 00:23:58.438
I really need your help.

293
00:24:00.315 --> 00:24:02.693
I made a mistake.

294
00:24:02.860 --> 00:24:05.195
I trusted someone
I shouldn't have, and...

295
00:24:06.864 --> 00:24:08.699
...now the world's broken.

296
00:24:12.953 --> 00:24:14.413
Sisudatu...

297
00:24:16.331 --> 00:24:20.169
I just really, really
want my ba back.

298
00:24:22.421 --> 00:24:24.047
Please.

299
00:24:33.432 --> 00:24:34.433
Okay...

300
00:24:38.854 --> 00:24:41.106
Here goes everything.

301
00:24:43.609 --> 00:24:45.944
Suvaa de draa sim

302
00:24:46.737 --> 00:24:49.072
Mandra de draa lim

303
00:24:50.073 --> 00:24:53.785
Bavaa de draa
Tomben

304
00:25:16.099 --> 00:25:18.101
I know, buddy,
I haven't forgot...

305
00:25:35.744 --> 00:25:37.496
Oh, my... Where am I?

306
00:25:37.663 --> 00:25:41.291
Pengu? Amba? Pranee?
Are you here?

307
00:25:41.458 --> 00:25:42.459
Oh, Mighty Sisu.

308
00:25:42.626 --> 00:25:43.961
Who said that?

309
00:25:45.379 --> 00:25:46.505
Hello?

310
00:25:48.298 --> 00:25:49.299
Hello?

311
00:25:49.383 --> 00:25:51.260
Oh!

312
00:25:51.343 --> 00:25:53.011
Oh, I'm sorry.
I didn't see you there.

313
00:25:53.095 --> 00:25:54.721
Not too bad.
Just a little dusty.

314
00:25:54.805 --> 00:25:56.139
Let me get that for ya.

315
00:25:56.223 --> 00:25:57.349
Sisu?

316
00:25:57.891 --> 00:26:01.061
You are Sisu?

317
00:26:01.228 --> 00:26:03.146
And you're people.

318
00:26:03.313 --> 00:26:04.398
What's your name?

319
00:26:04.481 --> 00:26:05.482
Raya. I'm Raya.

320
00:26:05.649 --> 00:26:08.902
And you're not made of stone,
which means...

321
00:26:08.986 --> 00:26:09.987
It worked!

322
00:26:10.070 --> 00:26:11.071
We did it!

323
00:26:11.154 --> 00:26:13.156
You hear that, Pengu?
It worked!

324
00:26:13.323 --> 00:26:14.658
I didn't mess it up!

325
00:26:15.033 --> 00:26:16.118
Is that food?

326
00:26:16.285 --> 00:26:17.744
I was so focused
on saving the world,

327
00:26:17.828 --> 00:26:19.079
I forgot to have
breakfast today.

328
00:26:19.454 --> 00:26:20.664
Today?

329
00:26:20.831 --> 00:26:23.000
When exactly
do you think today is?

330
00:26:23.166 --> 00:26:24.168
Tuesday.

331
00:26:25.669 --> 00:26:27.379
I mean...
Mmm.

332
00:26:27.546 --> 00:26:29.756
What is this delightful
culinary treat?

333
00:26:29.923 --> 00:26:34.261
It's jackfruit jerky.
I dried it myself.

334
00:26:34.428 --> 00:26:36.972
Well, compliments to the chef.

335
00:26:37.055 --> 00:26:38.056
Wanna finish this, Skippy?

336
00:26:39.224 --> 00:26:40.225
Uh...

337
00:26:40.309 --> 00:26:44.229
Sisu, there are a few things
I need to catch you up on.

338
00:26:44.396 --> 00:26:45.397
Oh, yeah?

339
00:26:46.398 --> 00:26:47.858
You broke it?

340
00:26:49.276 --> 00:26:52.571
Oh, oh. Oh, my. This is bad.
This is bad.

341
00:26:52.738 --> 00:26:54.656
I've been asleep
for 500 years,

342
00:26:54.823 --> 00:26:56.491
you brought back
the Druun,

343
00:26:56.658 --> 00:26:58.035
and none of my brothers
and sisters came back.

344
00:26:58.202 --> 00:26:59.536
Why didn't they come back?

345
00:26:59.703 --> 00:27:00.787
I don't know.

346
00:27:00.954 --> 00:27:02.289
Also, you broke the gem!

347
00:27:02.456 --> 00:27:04.249
But I still have
a big chunk of it, though.

348
00:27:04.416 --> 00:27:05.959
Is that supposed
to make me feel better?

349
00:27:06.126 --> 00:27:08.253
If you lost a puppy,
and I said...

350
00:27:08.420 --> 00:27:10.130
"Well, we still
have a big chunk of it!"

351
00:27:10.297 --> 00:27:12.841
Would that make you
feel better?

352
00:27:13.008 --> 00:27:14.676
Can't you just make
another one?

353
00:27:14.843 --> 00:27:16.678
No, I can't just
"make another one."

354
00:27:16.845 --> 00:27:18.722
But you're a dragon.

355
00:27:19.431 --> 00:27:21.016
I'm gonna be real
with you, all right?

356
00:27:21.183 --> 00:27:24.853
I'm not, like,
the best dragon, ya know?

357
00:27:25.020 --> 00:27:27.147
But you saved the world.

358
00:27:27.314 --> 00:27:29.691
I did do that. That's true.

359
00:27:29.858 --> 00:27:31.318
But have you ever done
like a group project,

360
00:27:31.401 --> 00:27:32.402
but there's, like,
that one kid

361
00:27:32.486 --> 00:27:33.570
who didn't pitch in as much,

362
00:27:33.654 --> 00:27:35.906
but still ended up
with the same grade?

363
00:27:36.740 --> 00:27:39.535
Yeah, I wasn't the one
who actually made the gem.

364
00:27:39.743 --> 00:27:41.662
I just turned it in.

365
00:27:43.789 --> 00:27:44.998
Whoa. Uh...

366
00:27:45.082 --> 00:27:47.084
You're glowing.

367
00:27:47.167 --> 00:27:48.710
Oh, thank you.

368
00:27:48.877 --> 00:27:50.504
I use aloe and river slime
to maintain my...

369
00:27:50.587 --> 00:27:52.297
No, no. Look!

370
00:27:52.506 --> 00:27:55.384
Oh! This is my little sister
Amba's magic.

371
00:27:55.509 --> 00:27:56.677
I got the glow!

372
00:27:56.844 --> 00:27:58.011
Your little sister's magic?

373
00:27:58.220 --> 00:27:59.972
Yeah, every dragon
has a unique magic.

374
00:28:00.138 --> 00:28:01.223
Okay, what's yours?

375
00:28:01.390 --> 00:28:05.018
I'm a really strong swimmer.

376
00:28:05.769 --> 00:28:07.688
Wait, wait, wait,
you touched this gem piece

377
00:28:07.771 --> 00:28:08.772
and it gave you powers.

378
00:28:08.939 --> 00:28:10.691
You know what
this means, right?

379
00:28:10.858 --> 00:28:12.693
I no longer need
a night light?

380
00:28:12.776 --> 00:28:15.904
What? No!
You're still connected to the gem's magic,

381
00:28:15.988 --> 00:28:17.322
and that means
you can still use it

382
00:28:17.406 --> 00:28:18.407
to save the world.

383
00:28:18.615 --> 00:28:20.117
If we can get
all the other gem pieces...

384
00:28:20.200 --> 00:28:21.577
- I can reassemble it...
- ...you can reassemble it...

385
00:28:21.660 --> 00:28:23.328
...and boom
the Druun away!

386
00:28:23.954 --> 00:28:25.038
And bring my ba back?

387
00:28:25.205 --> 00:28:27.374
And bring
all of Kumandra back.

388
00:29:03.535 --> 00:29:04.536
Princess Namaari,

389
00:29:04.620 --> 00:29:06.413
the Tail lands
are infested with Druun.

390
00:29:06.580 --> 00:29:08.874
Benja's daughter is as good
as stone out here.

391
00:29:08.957 --> 00:29:11.793
Retrieving
some useless dragon scroll

392
00:29:11.877 --> 00:29:13.670
isn't worth the risk.

393
00:29:17.966 --> 00:29:20.427
Anyone else wanna question
why we're out here?

394
00:29:37.194 --> 00:29:38.862
Okay, so here's the sitch.

395
00:29:39.029 --> 00:29:40.697
After the gem broke,
each piece was taken

396
00:29:40.781 --> 00:29:42.699
by one of the chiefs
of the five lands,

397
00:29:43.158 --> 00:29:46.537
Fang, Heart, Spine, Talon,
and Tail.

398
00:29:46.745 --> 00:29:48.205
Where we are now.

399
00:29:50.582 --> 00:29:52.209
Wow. So many questions.

400
00:29:52.543 --> 00:29:54.711
First one,
why am I wearing this?

401
00:29:54.878 --> 00:29:57.589
Well, we don't want
to attract attention.

402
00:29:57.881 --> 00:29:59.883
Oh, you definitely chose
the right hat for that.

403
00:30:00.634 --> 00:30:01.885
So, what makes you think
the Tail chief's here?

404
00:30:08.058 --> 00:30:11.520
Because this place
didn't just booby-trap itself.

405
00:30:15.858 --> 00:30:17.192
This doesn't make sense.

406
00:30:17.359 --> 00:30:18.819
None of this
would stop a Druun.

407
00:30:19.027 --> 00:30:21.446
It's not to stop Druun.
It's to stop people.

408
00:30:21.530 --> 00:30:22.614
Hmm.

409
00:30:32.082 --> 00:30:33.125
What?

410
00:30:33.292 --> 00:30:35.043
Why are you looking at me
like that?

411
00:30:35.127 --> 00:30:37.337
Nothing.

412
00:30:37.504 --> 00:30:39.590
I'm just not used to
seeing dragons.

413
00:30:39.673 --> 00:30:42.593
Impressed, huh? Wait until
you see my backstroke.

414
00:30:42.759 --> 00:30:44.595
I'm wicked
when I hit that liquid.

415
00:30:44.761 --> 00:30:46.555
I got water skills that kill.

416
00:30:46.722 --> 00:30:48.724
I slaughter
when I hit the water.

417
00:30:49.057 --> 00:30:52.853
I'm, like, really good
at swimming, through rhyme.

418
00:30:53.020 --> 00:30:54.021
I was trying to make that...

419
00:30:54.104 --> 00:30:55.147
That I'm really good
at swim...

420
00:30:55.314 --> 00:30:57.191
I'm a good swimmer,
is basically what I'm...

421
00:30:57.357 --> 00:30:59.610
Okay, um,
we need to keep going.

422
00:31:04.865 --> 00:31:06.700
- Oh, no!
- What? What is it?

423
00:31:06.867 --> 00:31:09.411
We forgot to bring a gift
for the Tail chief.

424
00:31:09.578 --> 00:31:10.829
I'm sorry. A gift?

425
00:31:10.996 --> 00:31:12.456
Yeah. A gift says,

426
00:31:12.539 --> 00:31:15.125
"You can trust me,
can I trust you?"

427
00:31:17.294 --> 00:31:19.546
Aw. Hey there,
little fella.

428
00:31:20.714 --> 00:31:22.049
This beetle's got a booty.

429
00:31:22.216 --> 00:31:24.384
Uh... Careful.
It's a Toot N Boom.

430
00:31:24.551 --> 00:31:25.802
Why is it called a...

431
00:31:29.348 --> 00:31:31.558
Got it. Noted. Makes sense.

432
00:31:37.564 --> 00:31:39.066
Uh...

433
00:31:39.149 --> 00:31:40.150
You have to admit though,

434
00:31:40.234 --> 00:31:41.777
these bug booties
are kind of cute.

435
00:31:50.077 --> 00:31:52.246
I'd say
we found the Tail chief.

436
00:31:52.412 --> 00:31:53.789
What happened to her?

437
00:31:53.956 --> 00:31:54.998
From the looks of it,

438
00:31:55.165 --> 00:31:56.583
she was hoarding the gem

439
00:31:56.667 --> 00:31:58.710
and became a victim
of her own traps.

440
00:31:58.877 --> 00:32:01.129
Well, you gotta admire
her commitment.

441
00:32:05.217 --> 00:32:07.219
Okay. Hold on.

442
00:32:11.014 --> 00:32:13.100
Oh, we were doing
a jumpy thing!

443
00:32:13.267 --> 00:32:14.643
So sorry. My bad.

444
00:32:14.726 --> 00:32:16.770
I get it now. I'm with it.

445
00:32:23.402 --> 00:32:24.486
Sisu...

446
00:32:24.820 --> 00:32:26.029
don't.

447
00:32:52.014 --> 00:32:53.557
Two down, three to go.

448
00:32:59.563 --> 00:33:02.024
I just shapechanged!
Into people!

449
00:33:02.191 --> 00:33:03.525
Dragons can do that?

450
00:33:03.692 --> 00:33:05.569
This was my sister
Pranee's thing.

451
00:33:05.736 --> 00:33:08.405
Look at my people arms
and my people face.

452
00:33:08.572 --> 00:33:10.657
Look how close my butt is
to my head.

453
00:33:11.200 --> 00:33:12.618
Now that
you don't have to hide me,

454
00:33:12.784 --> 00:33:14.703
getting the rest of the gems
is gonna be a breeze.

455
00:33:14.870 --> 00:33:17.122
Yeah, well, this one was easy,

456
00:33:17.206 --> 00:33:18.665
but the rest of them
are being held

457
00:33:18.832 --> 00:33:21.793
by a bunch
of no-good binturis.

458
00:33:21.960 --> 00:33:23.253
Binturi?

459
00:33:23.545 --> 00:33:26.590
That's not a very nice way
to describe an old friend.

460
00:33:29.426 --> 00:33:30.719
Namaari.

461
00:33:30.886 --> 00:33:32.638
What's drippin', dep la?

462
00:33:32.804 --> 00:33:35.390
Oh, I see you've finally
made a new friend.

463
00:33:35.557 --> 00:33:36.892
And here I was worried

464
00:33:36.975 --> 00:33:39.144
you were gonna end up
becoming a cat lady

465
00:33:39.561 --> 00:33:40.562
like me.

466
00:33:42.147 --> 00:33:43.899
Something tells me
you're not besties.

467
00:33:44.066 --> 00:33:47.236
Stealing Dragon Gem pieces,
are we? Why?

468
00:33:47.402 --> 00:33:50.113
What can I say?
Bling is my thing.

469
00:33:50.364 --> 00:33:51.365
Hmm.

470
00:33:51.448 --> 00:33:54.159
I gotta admit, Raya,
until a few months ago,

471
00:33:54.326 --> 00:33:55.577
I thought you were stone.

472
00:33:55.661 --> 00:33:58.455
But then, someone stole
Fang's dragon scroll.

473
00:33:58.622 --> 00:34:00.582
Oh, is that why
you're chasing me?

474
00:34:00.791 --> 00:34:03.126
And here I thought
it was because you missed me.

475
00:34:05.504 --> 00:34:08.715
Are you really looking
for Sisu?

476
00:34:10.300 --> 00:34:11.468
What are you, 12?

477
00:34:11.677 --> 00:34:14.221
Yeah, I actually was looking
for Sisu.

478
00:34:14.388 --> 00:34:16.932
Oh, and guess what?
I found her.

479
00:34:18.433 --> 00:34:19.810
Say hi, Sisu.

480
00:34:19.893 --> 00:34:20.936
Hi!

481
00:34:21.019 --> 00:34:22.312
It's very nice to meet you,

482
00:34:22.396 --> 00:34:26.108
and I love your hair
and your cats' hair.

483
00:34:27.276 --> 00:34:28.402
Take them.

484
00:34:38.954 --> 00:34:39.955
Run!

485
00:34:43.292 --> 00:34:44.626
Not like that! Two legs!

486
00:34:44.710 --> 00:34:45.711
Right!

487
00:35:01.935 --> 00:35:03.270
Tuk Tuk! Roll!

488
00:35:06.356 --> 00:35:07.357
Whoa!

489
00:35:15.741 --> 00:35:16.742
Jump!

490
00:35:18.619 --> 00:35:19.661
Who was that girl?

491
00:35:19.786 --> 00:35:20.787
That's Namaari.

492
00:35:20.954 --> 00:35:23.999
She's the backstabbing binturi
that broke the world.

493
00:35:32.466 --> 00:35:35.093
Wow, those cats
are really fast, huh?

494
00:35:36.303 --> 00:35:38.263
What do cats and Druun
have in common?

495
00:35:38.347 --> 00:35:41.558
Um... They have no souls?

496
00:35:41.808 --> 00:35:44.061
And they both hate water.

497
00:35:44.186 --> 00:35:45.646
- Oh.
- Hold on!

498
00:35:58.617 --> 00:36:00.536
Hello? Is anybody here?

499
00:36:04.665 --> 00:36:06.583
Welcome to the world-famous
Shrimp-orium.

500
00:36:06.750 --> 00:36:08.919
My name is Boun.
I'll be your server today.

501
00:36:09.086 --> 00:36:10.629
Would you like to hear
our daily specials?

502
00:36:10.796 --> 00:36:11.880
Yes, please!

503
00:36:11.964 --> 00:36:13.382
We got shrimp, we got congee.

504
00:36:13.465 --> 00:36:15.384
We got a shrimp congee
that won't quit.

505
00:36:15.551 --> 00:36:17.135
The captain,
where is the captain?

506
00:36:17.302 --> 00:36:18.595
Let me go get him.

507
00:36:20.305 --> 00:36:22.015
What's up, my new customers?

508
00:36:22.182 --> 00:36:23.642
I'm Captain Boun,

509
00:36:23.809 --> 00:36:26.436
the owner, chef,
and chief financial officer

510
00:36:26.520 --> 00:36:28.146
of the Shrimp-orium.

511
00:36:28.230 --> 00:36:29.231
How can I help you?

512
00:36:29.314 --> 00:36:30.649
Well, I'm Sisu and...

513
00:36:30.816 --> 00:36:32.568
And we need
to get to Talon now.

514
00:36:32.734 --> 00:36:35.112
I'm sorry. The Shrimp-orium
is not a water taxi.

515
00:36:35.195 --> 00:36:37.239
Toi, that's a lot of jade!

516
00:36:37.406 --> 00:36:40.242
Half now, half when we arrive
in Talon. Deal?

517
00:36:41.076 --> 00:36:42.578
Clasp onto your congee.

518
00:36:42.744 --> 00:36:44.454
Today's special is

519
00:36:44.621 --> 00:36:45.622
to go.

520
00:36:52.462 --> 00:36:54.840
Uh, Captain Boun?

521
00:36:54.923 --> 00:36:56.425
Does this thing go any faster?

522
00:36:58.385 --> 00:36:59.887
Whoa! You didn't tell me
Fang was after you!

523
00:37:00.053 --> 00:37:01.138
This is gonna cost you extra!

524
00:37:01.305 --> 00:37:02.514
Don't worry, I got it.

525
00:37:03.682 --> 00:37:05.184
What is she doing?

526
00:37:15.569 --> 00:37:16.987
What is happening?

527
00:37:17.070 --> 00:37:19.114
My friend's
a really strong swimmer.

528
00:37:25.329 --> 00:37:27.039
Bye-bye, binturi.

529
00:37:29.917 --> 00:37:32.085
Princess Namaari,
if they're after gem pieces,

530
00:37:32.252 --> 00:37:33.879
their next stop
would be Talon.

531
00:37:34.046 --> 00:37:35.589
We're not following them
to Talon.

532
00:37:35.756 --> 00:37:36.882
We're going back to Fang.

533
00:37:37.090 --> 00:37:38.842
I need to speak
with Chief Virana.

534
00:38:08.497 --> 00:38:10.207
Sisu? Sisu?

535
00:38:10.791 --> 00:38:11.792
Ah!

536
00:38:11.875 --> 00:38:13.418
Please get out of there.

537
00:38:13.585 --> 00:38:14.962
I'm a water dragon.

538
00:38:15.128 --> 00:38:16.964
This is water.
It's sort of my thing.

539
00:38:17.130 --> 00:38:18.340
You wanna come in?

540
00:38:18.507 --> 00:38:19.633
Someone could see you.

541
00:38:19.800 --> 00:38:22.511
Oh. Do you mean Captain Pop
and Lock over there?

542
00:38:22.678 --> 00:38:23.846
What, are you scared

543
00:38:23.929 --> 00:38:25.389
he's gonna challenge me
to a dance battle?

544
00:38:32.646 --> 00:38:35.732
Sisu, I saw people
lose their minds

545
00:38:35.816 --> 00:38:36.817
over a Dragon Gem.

546
00:38:36.984 --> 00:38:39.903
Can you imagine what they'd do
over an actual dragon?

547
00:38:40.070 --> 00:38:42.322
Look, we need you
to make this all work.

548
00:38:42.489 --> 00:38:45.409
Until we have all the gems,
you have to stay human.

549
00:38:45.492 --> 00:38:46.493
Please.

550
00:38:46.660 --> 00:38:48.287
Wow, you really
got some trust issues.

551
00:38:48.495 --> 00:38:51.164
Look, my father
blindly trusted people,

552
00:38:51.331 --> 00:38:53.584
and now, he's stone.

553
00:38:54.293 --> 00:38:55.669
Hey, we'll get your ba back.

554
00:38:56.837 --> 00:38:58.714
I got you, girl.
Come on, who's your dragon?

555
00:38:59.381 --> 00:39:02.926
I mean, human. Because
I'm gonna be a human until...

556
00:39:03.093 --> 00:39:04.094
Yeah, you... You get it.

557
00:39:07.639 --> 00:39:09.016
Okay, who's hungry?

558
00:39:09.224 --> 00:39:10.225
Oh, I am.

559
00:39:10.392 --> 00:39:12.352
Two house specials.
How spicy would you like it?

560
00:39:12.519 --> 00:39:14.980
Hot, hotter,
or Boun-goes-the-dynamite?

561
00:39:15.147 --> 00:39:16.481
- Bring on the heat!
- Yeah, no.

562
00:39:16.648 --> 00:39:18.108
No, I don't think so.

563
00:39:18.192 --> 00:39:19.401
Uh, what are you doing?

564
00:39:19.568 --> 00:39:20.944
We don't
know him. It could be poison.

565
00:39:21.111 --> 00:39:22.905
Why would he poison us?

566
00:39:23.071 --> 00:39:24.406
Yeah, why would I poison you?

567
00:39:24.573 --> 00:39:26.116
First, to get my jade purse,

568
00:39:26.283 --> 00:39:27.326
second, to steal my sword,

569
00:39:27.492 --> 00:39:31.038
and third, I don't know,
to kidnap my Tuk Tuk.

570
00:39:32.206 --> 00:39:34.625
All good points,
but if this is poison...

571
00:39:36.043 --> 00:39:37.044
Mmm!

572
00:39:37.127 --> 00:39:38.545
...you're gonna die happy.

573
00:39:38.712 --> 00:39:41.089
Yeah, thanks,
but we got our own eats.

574
00:39:45.052 --> 00:39:46.512
This is delicious.

575
00:39:46.678 --> 00:39:49.139
By the way, not poison.

576
00:39:50.724 --> 00:39:52.059
But it's...

577
00:39:53.227 --> 00:39:55.145
It's hot. Ooh, it's hot!

578
00:39:55.229 --> 00:39:57.064
It's hot! It's really hot!

579
00:39:57.314 --> 00:39:58.774
Oh, my! Oh! Water!

580
00:39:58.941 --> 00:40:01.485
Boun? Captain Boun?
We need water on deck!

581
00:41:21.064 --> 00:41:22.274
I know, buddy.

582
00:41:22.733 --> 00:41:25.235
You know, during the day,

583
00:41:25.611 --> 00:41:27.404
you can almost forget
they're here,

584
00:41:27.905 --> 00:41:29.198
but at night...

585
00:41:31.116 --> 00:41:33.243
This is why
I never leave the boat.

586
00:41:33.660 --> 00:41:35.120
You're a smart kid.

587
00:41:36.413 --> 00:41:38.207
What are Druun, anyways?

588
00:41:38.624 --> 00:41:42.169
A plague.
Born from human discord.

589
00:41:42.628 --> 00:41:44.546
They've always been here.

590
00:41:44.713 --> 00:41:48.008
Waiting for a moment
of weakness to attack.

591
00:41:48.926 --> 00:41:52.221
They're like
the opposite of dragons.

592
00:41:53.305 --> 00:41:56.767
Instead of bringing water
and life to the world,

593
00:41:56.934 --> 00:41:58.727
they're like a relentless fire

594
00:41:58.810 --> 00:42:00.479
that consumes everything
in its wake

595
00:42:00.646 --> 00:42:05.067
until there's nothing left
except ash and stone.

596
00:42:07.528 --> 00:42:09.321
They took my family.

597
00:42:14.701 --> 00:42:16.453
They took mine, too.

598
00:43:04.334 --> 00:43:05.752
Looks like we're here.

599
00:43:06.920 --> 00:43:10.507
So, where are you guys heading
after Talon?

600
00:43:10.966 --> 00:43:12.759
I might be heading there, too.

601
00:43:14.303 --> 00:43:16.430
I mean, for a fee, of course.

602
00:43:16.513 --> 00:43:18.849
Of course.

603
00:43:21.602 --> 00:43:24.897
Wow! What a smart way
to Druun-proof your house.

604
00:43:25.063 --> 00:43:26.148
Build right on the water.

605
00:43:26.356 --> 00:43:28.066
People of Talon are geniuses.

606
00:43:28.233 --> 00:43:30.235
Yeah. Talon may look nice,

607
00:43:30.402 --> 00:43:33.113
but it's a hotspot for
pickpockets and con artists.

608
00:43:33.280 --> 00:43:35.741
Lucky for me. Empty pockets!

609
00:43:35.949 --> 00:43:37.159
Okay, so here's the good news.

610
00:43:37.326 --> 00:43:38.869
I know where the gem piece is.

611
00:43:38.952 --> 00:43:39.953
The bad news?

612
00:43:40.037 --> 00:43:43.040
It's being held by
the notorious Chief of Talon,

613
00:43:43.123 --> 00:43:44.124
Dang Hai.

614
00:43:44.333 --> 00:43:47.753
What Dang Hai lacks in style,
he makes up in mean.

615
00:43:47.836 --> 00:43:48.837
Hmm.

616
00:43:49.213 --> 00:43:50.214
Gotcha.

617
00:43:50.297 --> 00:43:51.882
Now, we're just gonna have to
turn up the charm.

618
00:43:51.965 --> 00:43:53.008
Let's go get him a gift.

619
00:43:53.175 --> 00:43:55.636
Sisu, I think maybe
it's safer for you

620
00:43:55.719 --> 00:43:57.221
to stay here on the boat.

621
00:43:57.304 --> 00:43:58.305
What?

622
00:43:58.388 --> 00:44:01.141
Without you, we can't
put the gem back together.

623
00:44:01.308 --> 00:44:02.351
But I wanna help.

624
00:44:02.518 --> 00:44:04.186
I know, and you will.

625
00:44:04.394 --> 00:44:05.938
By staying safe.

626
00:44:06.438 --> 00:44:08.065
I'll be back
before you know it.

627
00:44:08.982 --> 00:44:12.194
If you see any hungry faces,
send 'em my way.

628
00:44:12.361 --> 00:44:14.112
You got it, Captain.

629
00:44:40.389 --> 00:44:42.558
All right,
there's Dang Hai's house.

630
00:44:42.766 --> 00:44:45.310
No detours
till we score that Dragon Gem.

631
00:44:46.603 --> 00:44:48.021
Whoa. What in the...

632
00:44:50.440 --> 00:44:52.609
Uh...

633
00:44:52.860 --> 00:44:54.069
Okay.

634
00:44:55.946 --> 00:44:59.408
Hey, baby, toddler, thing...

635
00:44:59.575 --> 00:45:00.659
...whatever you're called.

636
00:45:01.118 --> 00:45:03.453
It's really late.
What are you doing out here?

637
00:45:04.079 --> 00:45:05.706
Where are your parents?

638
00:45:05.956 --> 00:45:07.583
Hey, uh, whose baby...

639
00:45:08.125 --> 00:45:09.626
What? Ongis?

640
00:45:09.710 --> 00:45:10.711
Drop 'em!

641
00:45:11.879 --> 00:45:13.130
Ow!

642
00:45:16.967 --> 00:45:18.802
Really? A con-baby?

643
00:45:23.056 --> 00:45:24.892
Ah, this is giving me
bad feels.

644
00:45:25.058 --> 00:45:26.602
Chief Dang Hai
does not sound like

645
00:45:26.685 --> 00:45:27.978
someone you could smooth talk.

646
00:45:28.145 --> 00:45:29.897
And Raya
didn't even bring a gift.

647
00:45:30.397 --> 00:45:32.691
That's it. I'm going shopping.

648
00:45:32.941 --> 00:45:34.860
Oh, wait.
I don't have any money.

649
00:45:35.027 --> 00:45:36.153
You're an adult.

650
00:45:36.320 --> 00:45:37.529
You could just put it
on credit.

651
00:45:37.696 --> 00:45:39.323
Oh... Uh, what's credit?

652
00:45:39.489 --> 00:45:41.200
It's kinda like a promise.

653
00:45:41.366 --> 00:45:42.784
You take what you want now,

654
00:45:42.868 --> 00:45:44.369
and you promise
you'll pay it back later.

655
00:45:44.661 --> 00:45:46.538
Pay it back later? Huh!

656
00:45:46.997 --> 00:45:48.582
What an amazing concept.

657
00:45:48.749 --> 00:45:50.042
Thanks, Captain Boun.

658
00:45:54.004 --> 00:45:55.714
I'll be buying this
with credit.

659
00:45:57.090 --> 00:45:59.051
Oh, Dang Hai's
gonna love this!

660
00:45:59.218 --> 00:46:00.302
Credit, please.

661
00:46:00.469 --> 00:46:03.222
Oh, I like that. Uh, yeah,
I'll be using credit, yes.

662
00:46:03.889 --> 00:46:04.932
I love credit!

663
00:46:05.098 --> 00:46:06.225
Hey, you!

664
00:46:08.060 --> 00:46:10.103
Are you going
to pay for any of that?

665
00:46:10.187 --> 00:46:11.188
Oh!

666
00:46:11.271 --> 00:46:13.649
Right, right.
No, this is on credit.

667
00:46:13.815 --> 00:46:15.526
Yeah, I'm gonna pay it
back later.

668
00:46:15.692 --> 00:46:17.903
Pay us back later?
We don't know you.

669
00:46:18.070 --> 00:46:19.488
You have no credit here.

670
00:46:19.655 --> 00:46:21.573
- Pay us right now.
- Now?

671
00:46:22.115 --> 00:46:23.408
I don't have anything,

672
00:46:23.492 --> 00:46:25.702
but if I could just find
my girl Raya,

673
00:46:25.869 --> 00:46:28.038
she has a sword, dried eats,

674
00:46:28.205 --> 00:46:29.456
two Dragon Gem pieces.

675
00:46:29.623 --> 00:46:31.250
No, we don't!
What? Who said that?

676
00:46:31.416 --> 00:46:32.626
You better pay up, binturi.

677
00:46:32.793 --> 00:46:33.836
This isn't a charity.

678
00:46:34.002 --> 00:46:35.128
Who do you think
you're stealing from?

679
00:46:35.212 --> 00:46:37.172
Get away from her!

680
00:46:37.339 --> 00:46:39.341
Can't you see
she's new in town?

681
00:46:39.508 --> 00:46:41.760
Come, dear. Don't be afraid.

682
00:46:42.344 --> 00:46:43.637
It's okay.

683
00:46:53.522 --> 00:46:54.648
Hey, watch out!

684
00:47:13.625 --> 00:47:14.793
Bye!

685
00:47:20.757 --> 00:47:21.800
Diaper!

686
00:47:38.150 --> 00:47:39.151
Thanks.

687
00:47:39.318 --> 00:47:40.777
So, it's none of my business,

688
00:47:40.944 --> 00:47:42.905
but using your baby charm
to rip people off...

689
00:47:44.156 --> 00:47:45.532
...is super sketchy.

690
00:47:47.242 --> 00:47:48.619
All right,
where is your family?

691
00:47:50.204 --> 00:47:51.205
Mm.

692
00:47:54.708 --> 00:47:55.709
Oh...

693
00:47:57.294 --> 00:47:58.295
Right.

694
00:48:05.177 --> 00:48:06.261
Hey.

695
00:48:06.428 --> 00:48:08.931
How would you like to earn
some honest loot?

696
00:48:09.348 --> 00:48:10.349
Gah?

697
00:48:34.456 --> 00:48:35.666
All right, Dang Hai,

698
00:48:35.749 --> 00:48:37.292
I'll take that
Dragon Gem piece.

699
00:48:37.501 --> 00:48:39.419
Whoa! I'm not Dang Hai.

700
00:48:40.712 --> 00:48:43.006
I'm Chai, the flower guy.

701
00:48:43.257 --> 00:48:44.258
Where is Dang Hai?

702
00:48:44.341 --> 00:48:46.176
He's right over there.

703
00:48:47.511 --> 00:48:49.763
What? Who has his gem piece?

704
00:48:50.138 --> 00:48:52.474
The most vicious chief

705
00:48:52.558 --> 00:48:54.518
Talon has ever seen.

706
00:48:56.645 --> 00:48:59.189
Those folks were,
like, crazy mad.

707
00:48:59.356 --> 00:49:00.941
I just wanted
to bring some gifts

708
00:49:01.024 --> 00:49:02.401
to the Talon chief Dang Hai.

709
00:49:02.568 --> 00:49:04.903
Is that who
you're looking for, dear?

710
00:49:05.237 --> 00:49:07.531
I know exactly where he is.

711
00:49:07.656 --> 00:49:08.657
You do?

712
00:49:08.740 --> 00:49:10.284
Mm-hmm. I will take you there.

713
00:49:10.450 --> 00:49:13.245
See? That's what I've been
trying to tell my girl Raya.

714
00:49:13.412 --> 00:49:15.247
And she's all like,
"You can't trust people."

715
00:49:15.414 --> 00:49:16.498
"Don't talk to anyone."

716
00:49:16.665 --> 00:49:18.876
"I only eat terrible foods
I dried myself."

717
00:49:18.959 --> 00:49:20.794
Come, dear.

718
00:49:20.961 --> 00:49:24.214
Chief Dang Hai
is just outside the city,

719
00:49:24.381 --> 00:49:25.757
beyond the gates.

720
00:49:26.008 --> 00:49:28.802
Away from
the water, huh? Wow.

721
00:49:29.094 --> 00:49:31.013
He really likes living
on the edge.

722
00:49:32.014 --> 00:49:33.390
Hi there, Dang Hai.

723
00:49:33.473 --> 00:49:34.766
Um, I'm Sisu,

724
00:49:34.933 --> 00:49:38.562
and I've come here
to offer you some...

725
00:49:40.772 --> 00:49:41.857
Uh...

726
00:49:50.824 --> 00:49:52.367
Now, you're gonna tell me

727
00:49:52.534 --> 00:49:56.455
where I can find
those other Dragon Gem pieces,

728
00:49:56.622 --> 00:50:01.460
or I'll have to leave you
outside with that thing.

729
00:50:01.627 --> 00:50:02.794
Take your pick.

730
00:50:03.212 --> 00:50:05.005
But I... I trusted you.

731
00:50:05.172 --> 00:50:07.049
Big mistake.

732
00:50:07.257 --> 00:50:08.675
You better talk fast.

733
00:50:08.842 --> 00:50:11.136
It looks hungry.

734
00:50:13.639 --> 00:50:16.517
No. No, no. No, no, no!

735
00:50:17.726 --> 00:50:18.727
Raya!

736
00:50:18.810 --> 00:50:19.811
Stop her!

737
00:50:21.438 --> 00:50:23.482
Sisu, I told you
to stay on the boat.

738
00:50:23.815 --> 00:50:24.858
Sorry!

739
00:50:25.025 --> 00:50:26.693
Hold on to this for me,
will ya?

740
00:50:30.280 --> 00:50:31.281
Fog?

741
00:50:31.448 --> 00:50:33.992
Yeah. That was
my brother Jagan's magic.

742
00:50:34.159 --> 00:50:36.328
Okay.
Three down, two to go.

743
00:50:37.829 --> 00:50:39.581
All right, Captain Boun,
next stop, Spine...

744
00:50:39.665 --> 00:50:40.666
Aah!

745
00:50:42.417 --> 00:50:43.585
Thanks for the new customers!

746
00:50:43.752 --> 00:50:45.796
Yeah, I sort of promised
to buy them

747
00:50:45.879 --> 00:50:47.172
all the congee they could eat.

748
00:50:47.381 --> 00:50:49.800
Well, we're stuck with them
for a while

749
00:50:49.967 --> 00:50:52.594
'cause ongis have
nine stomachs.

750
00:50:52.678 --> 00:50:53.679
Oh, toi.

751
00:50:53.762 --> 00:50:54.763
I can't believe it.

752
00:50:54.930 --> 00:50:56.640
That old lady
was really gonna hurt me.

753
00:50:56.807 --> 00:50:58.976
Well, I'm sorry, Sisu,

754
00:50:59.059 --> 00:51:01.019
but that's what
the world is now.

755
00:51:01.186 --> 00:51:02.771
You can't trust anyone.

756
00:51:04.147 --> 00:51:05.607
Does that include babies?

757
00:51:05.691 --> 00:51:07.985
- Uh, well...
- She's so cute.

758
00:51:08.151 --> 00:51:09.778
I mean, look at those cheeks.

759
00:51:11.655 --> 00:51:13.282
Hi, I'm Sisu.

760
00:51:18.036 --> 00:51:19.371
She loves my face.

761
00:51:19.538 --> 00:51:22.416
Yeah, watch out
she doesn't steal your teeth.

762
00:51:22.583 --> 00:51:23.834
Here, let me help you.

763
00:51:24.001 --> 00:51:25.627
Oh, that's so sweet.

764
00:51:25.919 --> 00:51:28.255
Okay, that's, uh...
That's too much sweet...

765
00:51:28.422 --> 00:51:30.215
Too much sweetness.
It's too much!

766
00:51:44.229 --> 00:51:46.190
Chief Virana,
we're running out of room.

767
00:51:46.773 --> 00:51:48.650
We need to expand
to the mainland.

768
00:51:48.817 --> 00:51:50.652
And how do you propose
we handle the Druun,

769
00:51:50.736 --> 00:51:52.154
General Atitāya?

770
00:51:52.279 --> 00:51:53.280
Without proper protection,

771
00:51:53.363 --> 00:51:55.532
it would be a death sentence
for our people.

772
00:51:55.699 --> 00:51:57.743
I might have a solution
for that, Mother.

773
00:51:57.826 --> 00:52:00.245
My little morning mist...

774
00:52:00.412 --> 00:52:02.372
Oh, it's good to see you home.

775
00:52:02.831 --> 00:52:05.584
I located Raya.
She's out stealing gem pieces.

776
00:52:05.834 --> 00:52:06.835
What?

777
00:52:07.044 --> 00:52:08.545
I'd like to take
the royal army

778
00:52:08.629 --> 00:52:10.130
and intercept her in Spine.

779
00:52:10.214 --> 00:52:12.758
Well,
if she's going into Spine,

780
00:52:13.342 --> 00:52:15.427
I doubt there'll be much left
of her to intercept.

781
00:52:15.594 --> 00:52:17.387
She's more capable
than you realize.

782
00:52:17.763 --> 00:52:19.097
We have to stop her.

783
00:52:20.516 --> 00:52:21.892
Walk with me.

784
00:52:23.435 --> 00:52:24.686
Look around.

785
00:52:24.853 --> 00:52:28.398
We made all this
by making smart decisions,

786
00:52:28.482 --> 00:52:29.733
not emotional ones.

787
00:52:30.609 --> 00:52:31.985
We are safe.

788
00:52:32.152 --> 00:52:35.072
Our canal protects us
from those monsters.

789
00:52:35.447 --> 00:52:37.616
I don't think it's wise
to risk yourself

790
00:52:37.699 --> 00:52:38.867
when you don't have to.

791
00:52:39.368 --> 00:52:40.536
But you heard the general.

792
00:52:40.702 --> 00:52:43.288
We're running out of space.
We need to expand.

793
00:52:43.455 --> 00:52:47.000
If we had all the gem pieces,
we could do that safely.

794
00:52:47.125 --> 00:52:48.126
You're right.

795
00:52:48.293 --> 00:52:50.045
This isn't
an emotional decision.

796
00:52:50.212 --> 00:52:51.839
It's the only decision
we can make

797
00:52:51.922 --> 00:52:53.549
to secure Fang's future.

798
00:52:58.804 --> 00:53:01.932
Namaari, you're truly growing

799
00:53:02.015 --> 00:53:04.017
into the leader
I raised you to be.

800
00:53:04.810 --> 00:53:07.145
General Atitāya,
ready the royal army

801
00:53:07.229 --> 00:53:08.647
for my daughter's command.

802
00:53:08.730 --> 00:53:11.400
Thank you, Mother.
I won't let you down.

803
00:53:18.699 --> 00:53:20.450
Hey! Stop eating!

804
00:53:25.080 --> 00:53:26.081
Whoa!

805
00:53:27.624 --> 00:53:29.084
Sorry, buddy, I got this.

806
00:53:29.251 --> 00:53:30.544
Did you just throw
a shrimp at me?

807
00:53:30.711 --> 00:53:31.920
That's not even edible!

808
00:53:32.004 --> 00:53:33.130
- Hey!
- Don't look at me...

809
00:53:33.213 --> 00:53:34.214
Uh... Hey, guys?

810
00:53:34.298 --> 00:53:35.340
...like that,
you fuzzy garbage can!

811
00:53:35.424 --> 00:53:36.717
Do you wanna play
hide-and-seek?

812
00:53:38.468 --> 00:53:40.012
All right. Ready?

813
00:53:40.804 --> 00:53:42.431
One.

814
00:53:43.682 --> 00:53:44.808
Two.

815
00:53:45.726 --> 00:53:48.228
- Thanks.
- Two and a half.

816
00:53:49.062 --> 00:53:50.063
Three.

817
00:53:51.106 --> 00:53:52.858
Remind me to never have kids.

818
00:53:53.525 --> 00:53:55.360
Being people is hard.

819
00:53:55.444 --> 00:53:56.445
Yep.

820
00:53:56.570 --> 00:53:57.988
Six.

821
00:53:58.530 --> 00:53:59.781
Seven.

822
00:54:00.157 --> 00:54:01.617
You have small heads.

823
00:54:01.783 --> 00:54:02.826
No tails.

824
00:54:02.993 --> 00:54:04.661
You lie to get what you want,

825
00:54:04.745 --> 00:54:06.163
like the Talon chief
back there.

826
00:54:06.330 --> 00:54:08.081
Yeah, well,
the world's broken.

827
00:54:08.248 --> 00:54:09.708
You can't trust anyone.

828
00:54:09.875 --> 00:54:11.585
Or maybe the world's broken

829
00:54:11.668 --> 00:54:13.337
because you don't
trust anyone.

830
00:54:13.420 --> 00:54:15.756
You sound just like my ba.

831
00:54:16.048 --> 00:54:17.508
Well, he sounds like
a smart man.

832
00:54:17.883 --> 00:54:19.343
Yeah, he was.

833
00:54:19.510 --> 00:54:21.470
I really wanted
to believe him.

834
00:54:21.637 --> 00:54:22.930
I really wanted to believe

835
00:54:23.013 --> 00:54:25.098
that we could be
Kumandra again.

836
00:54:25.265 --> 00:54:26.350
And we can.

837
00:54:26.517 --> 00:54:28.852
Literally thousands of people
turned to stone

838
00:54:28.936 --> 00:54:30.103
would argue otherwise.

839
00:54:30.270 --> 00:54:32.147
That doesn't mean
you shouldn't try.

840
00:54:32.314 --> 00:54:35.067
And I did.
And you know what happened?

841
00:54:35.234 --> 00:54:38.362
I got kicked in the back
by someone who gave me a gift.

842
00:54:39.196 --> 00:54:40.280
Look around.

843
00:54:40.447 --> 00:54:42.157
We're a world
of orphans because

844
00:54:42.241 --> 00:54:44.368
people couldn't stop fighting
over a gem.

845
00:54:44.535 --> 00:54:46.703
Wanna know why other dragons
didn't come back?

846
00:54:47.246 --> 00:54:49.748
It's because
people don't deserve them.

847
00:54:49.915 --> 00:54:51.166
But you can change that.

848
00:54:51.333 --> 00:54:53.669
No, Sisu, I am done trying.

849
00:54:53.836 --> 00:54:55.295
Kumandra is a fairy tale.

850
00:54:55.462 --> 00:54:57.214
The only thing
important to me now

851
00:54:57.297 --> 00:54:58.549
is bringing my ba back.

852
00:55:00.300 --> 00:55:02.302
Um... I think we're in Spine.

853
00:55:08.183 --> 00:55:09.184
Sisu!

854
00:55:09.268 --> 00:55:10.853
Hey, my congee!

855
00:55:11.019 --> 00:55:13.730
Don't go anywhere.
I'll be right back.

856
00:55:25.701 --> 00:55:27.661
Sisu! Come back! Please!

857
00:55:27.828 --> 00:55:28.912
What... What are you doing?

858
00:55:29.079 --> 00:55:30.831
I'm going to show you
that you're wrong!

859
00:55:30.998 --> 00:55:34.501
How? By getting squashed by
a bunch of Spine rage-heads?

860
00:55:34.585 --> 00:55:35.586
No.

861
00:55:35.669 --> 00:55:36.712
By proving to you

862
00:55:36.795 --> 00:55:38.463
that if you wanna get
someone's trust,

863
00:55:38.630 --> 00:55:40.090
you have to give
a little trust first.

864
00:55:40.174 --> 00:55:41.383
Wait, Sisu, don't...

865
00:55:44.428 --> 00:55:47.472
In hindsight,
maybe I was a little hasty,

866
00:55:47.723 --> 00:55:49.266
but, uh, who's hungry?

867
00:55:49.433 --> 00:55:51.226
No? I'll leave you alone.

868
00:55:55.314 --> 00:55:56.982
Okay, where are we?

869
00:55:59.610 --> 00:56:01.028
Interesting choice of digs.

870
00:56:07.242 --> 00:56:09.328
You two must be
dung of brain

871
00:56:09.494 --> 00:56:12.956
to think you could steal
Spine's Dragon Gem.

872
00:56:14.124 --> 00:56:15.125
Gem?

873
00:56:15.250 --> 00:56:16.752
Who said anything about gems?

874
00:56:16.835 --> 00:56:17.836
We have no interest in gems.

875
00:56:19.046 --> 00:56:20.047
Okay, yeah, I can see how

876
00:56:20.130 --> 00:56:21.340
that makes me look
like a liar.

877
00:56:21.507 --> 00:56:22.966
Actually, I think
it was the lying

878
00:56:23.050 --> 00:56:24.051
that made you look
like a liar.

879
00:56:30.098 --> 00:56:31.141
I'm not sure what's funny.

880
00:56:31.308 --> 00:56:34.603
Your fear
is like delectable nectar

881
00:56:34.770 --> 00:56:37.731
feeding the tum-tum
of my soul.

882
00:56:37.898 --> 00:56:39.107
It's good.

883
00:56:39.274 --> 00:56:41.485
Tastes like... mango.

884
00:56:41.652 --> 00:56:43.111
Oh. I love mango.

885
00:56:43.320 --> 00:56:45.489
Of course you love mango!

886
00:56:45.656 --> 00:56:47.699
Only a tongue-less
cretin wouldn't.

887
00:56:47.783 --> 00:56:48.784
Oh, toi!

888
00:56:48.867 --> 00:56:50.410
It's been such a long time

889
00:56:50.494 --> 00:56:51.578
since I've last peered

890
00:56:51.662 --> 00:56:53.830
into the eyes
of a trembling enemy.

891
00:56:54.289 --> 00:56:56.333
Where has the time gone?

892
00:56:57.251 --> 00:56:59.336
It's been so long.

893
00:57:00.671 --> 00:57:01.713
He seems lonely.

894
00:57:01.797 --> 00:57:03.507
No! I'm not lonely.

895
00:57:03.674 --> 00:57:05.342
I'm a Spine warrior.

896
00:57:05.509 --> 00:57:08.470
I was born and bred to do
only one thing.

897
00:57:08.637 --> 00:57:10.097
To invoke fear

898
00:57:10.180 --> 00:57:12.975
and to crush the skulls
of my enemies!

899
00:57:13.141 --> 00:57:14.268
That's actually two things.

900
00:57:16.812 --> 00:57:19.147
Look at your face.

901
00:57:19.231 --> 00:57:21.692
Hey. What do you plan on doing
with us?

902
00:57:21.775 --> 00:57:23.777
Oh, it's gonna be bad.

903
00:57:23.944 --> 00:57:25.153
Horrifying!

904
00:57:25.320 --> 00:57:27.197
It'll take me two weeks
to clean up!

905
00:57:27.364 --> 00:57:29.116
You have no idea, do you?

906
00:57:29.199 --> 00:57:30.200
Yes, I do.

907
00:57:30.284 --> 00:57:33.662
I'm formulating this
gruesome plan in my head...

908
00:57:33.829 --> 00:57:36.164
Makes me sick
just thinking about it.

909
00:57:36.331 --> 00:57:37.875
You... You just wait.

910
00:57:38.041 --> 00:57:41.503
Until then, why don't you
just hang around?

911
00:57:41.587 --> 00:57:42.588
Good one, huh?

912
00:57:51.471 --> 00:57:52.472
Huh?

913
00:57:54.016 --> 00:57:55.267
A little one?

914
00:57:55.434 --> 00:57:56.852
All right!

915
00:57:56.935 --> 00:57:58.270
Phew! Good work, Captain Boun!

916
00:57:58.437 --> 00:57:59.438
- Fang's here!
- What?

917
00:57:59.646 --> 00:58:02.941
People of Spine,
we are hunting for Raya,

918
00:58:03.108 --> 00:58:04.860
a fugitive from Heart!

919
00:58:05.027 --> 00:58:07.279
Send her out,
or we're coming in!

920
00:58:09.948 --> 00:58:11.325
You're the only one here?

921
00:58:11.783 --> 00:58:14.786
My people battled the Druun
with much valor,

922
00:58:15.078 --> 00:58:16.121
but lost.

923
00:58:25.589 --> 00:58:26.590
Okay.

924
00:58:26.673 --> 00:58:28.884
But the Fang gang's here
for me, not for you,

925
00:58:29.051 --> 00:58:30.677
so, um,
if I can distract them,

926
00:58:30.761 --> 00:58:32.012
then you guys
can get out of here.

927
00:58:32.179 --> 00:58:33.680
You're gonna fight
an entire army?

928
00:58:33.847 --> 00:58:35.349
No, I'm just gonna stall them.

929
00:58:35.516 --> 00:58:37.476
Look, I know how to push
Namaari's buttons.

930
00:58:37.643 --> 00:58:40.145
And once you guys are clear,
I'm out of there.

931
00:58:45.234 --> 00:58:46.235
What's your name?

932
00:58:46.401 --> 00:58:48.570
The moniker given to me
is Tong.

933
00:58:48.737 --> 00:58:50.656
Okay, Tong, look,
you don't know me,

934
00:58:50.739 --> 00:58:51.740
and I don't know you,

935
00:58:51.907 --> 00:58:53.742
but I'm sure that
you know a back door

936
00:58:53.825 --> 00:58:54.826
or a way outta here,

937
00:58:54.993 --> 00:58:57.788
and it's really important that
my friends stay safe, okay?

938
00:58:57.955 --> 00:59:01.917
So, I am sincerely asking you,
will you help us?

939
00:59:02.918 --> 00:59:04.044
Please.

940
00:59:13.554 --> 00:59:15.097
Okay.

941
00:59:15.764 --> 00:59:17.182
Note to self,

942
00:59:17.558 --> 00:59:18.809
don't die.

943
00:59:19.685 --> 00:59:21.019
Burn them out.

944
00:59:28.610 --> 00:59:30.696
Hey there, Princess Undercut.

945
00:59:30.863 --> 00:59:31.864
Fancy meeting you here.

946
00:59:32.030 --> 00:59:33.407
You
and the Dragon Gem pieces

947
00:59:33.490 --> 00:59:34.616
are coming with me.

948
00:59:34.700 --> 00:59:36.952
Hmm.
My sword here says we're not.

949
00:59:38.787 --> 00:59:41.540
Yeah, I knew you couldn't
handle rolling solo.

950
00:59:41.707 --> 00:59:43.667
You're nothing
without your band.

951
00:59:44.418 --> 00:59:45.711
Stand down.

952
00:59:46.587 --> 00:59:48.046
This shouldn't take long.

953
01:00:12.237 --> 01:00:13.614
Did you need that, dep la?

954
01:00:15.490 --> 01:00:16.491
Nah.

955
01:00:16.575 --> 01:00:19.494
Looks like somebody's
been taking classes.

956
01:00:34.510 --> 01:00:36.220
Why are you stealing
gem pieces?

957
01:00:39.765 --> 01:00:43.227
Oh, I'm just
trying to get a matching set.

958
01:00:48.440 --> 01:00:51.193
You didn't happen
to bring Fang's gem, did you?

959
01:01:00.494 --> 01:01:03.413
No? Never mind.

960
01:01:03.580 --> 01:01:06.250
I'll just swing by
and grab it later.

961
01:01:07.709 --> 01:01:10.045
Oh, I'm gonna enjoy this.

962
01:01:38.365 --> 01:01:40.325
Yep, she's a dragon.

963
01:01:40.492 --> 01:01:41.660
Let's go.

964
01:01:41.827 --> 01:01:42.828
Come on!

965
01:02:06.059 --> 01:02:07.728
Did you just hit me
with a shrimp tail?

966
01:02:09.104 --> 01:02:11.273
When were you gonna tell us
she was Sisu?

967
01:02:11.440 --> 01:02:13.775
Well, technically,
you always knew she was Sisu.

968
01:02:14.526 --> 01:02:15.527
Seriously?

969
01:02:15.777 --> 01:02:17.196
Why are you here,

970
01:02:17.279 --> 01:02:18.906
divine water dragon?

971
01:02:18.989 --> 01:02:20.532
Isn't that obvious, big guy?

972
01:02:20.616 --> 01:02:22.701
My girl Raya and I
are gonna fix the world.

973
01:02:22.784 --> 01:02:24.203
Bring everyone back.

974
01:02:24.286 --> 01:02:26.038
You're gonna
bring everyone back?

975
01:02:26.121 --> 01:02:27.122
I wanna help.

976
01:02:27.372 --> 01:02:30.584
I'm sorry,
I can't let you do that.

977
01:02:30.751 --> 01:02:31.877
It's too dangerous.

978
01:02:31.960 --> 01:02:35.714
You're not the only one
who lost family to the Druun.

979
01:02:39.468 --> 01:02:40.469
Please.

980
01:02:40.886 --> 01:02:42.346
Let me help you.

981
01:02:51.021 --> 01:02:53.106
I too wish to join
this fellowship

982
01:02:53.190 --> 01:02:55.484
of Druun butt-kickery!

983
01:03:07.788 --> 01:03:10.040
My big brother Pengu's magic.

984
01:04:16.273 --> 01:04:18.400
All right, Captain Boun.
To Fang.

985
01:04:18.692 --> 01:04:19.776
You got it!

986
01:04:38.337 --> 01:04:40.839
All right, everyone,
here's the plan.

987
01:04:41.006 --> 01:04:43.008
The last gem piece is in Fang,

988
01:04:43.175 --> 01:04:45.928
the most heavily guarded
of the five lands.

989
01:04:46.220 --> 01:04:48.180
Now, they're protected
by an artificial canal

990
01:04:48.347 --> 01:04:50.641
that separates them
from the rest of the world.

991
01:04:50.807 --> 01:04:52.351
The only way in or out

992
01:04:52.518 --> 01:04:53.977
is by water.

993
01:04:58.607 --> 01:05:02.694
Luckily for us,
we have a magic water dragon.

994
01:05:04.821 --> 01:05:07.115
Now, the palace will be
swarmingwith Fang soldiers.

995
01:05:07.616 --> 01:05:09.034
To sneak past them,
we'll need to...

996
01:05:09.201 --> 01:05:10.452
I got this, guys.

997
01:05:10.702 --> 01:05:12.037
I'll take care
of the first wave.

998
01:05:14.206 --> 01:05:15.207
Tong will follow up

999
01:05:15.290 --> 01:05:17.209
with hisgiant axe
of bad-axery.

1000
01:05:18.418 --> 01:05:21.046
And then come the ongis
and that crazy con-baby...

1001
01:05:23.048 --> 01:05:26.134
...who will toss the gem
to the Mighty Sisudatu.

1002
01:05:27.553 --> 01:05:30.472
And then, bye-bye, binturis.

1003
01:05:34.810 --> 01:05:36.895
Super flow plan, am I right?

1004
01:05:37.437 --> 01:05:40.065
Uh, no. Yeah, that's not flow.
That's a clog.

1005
01:05:40.148 --> 01:05:41.149
I agree.

1006
01:05:41.650 --> 01:05:42.734
Here's my plan.

1007
01:05:43.318 --> 01:05:44.444
We infiltrate Fang,

1008
01:05:44.611 --> 01:05:46.113
confront Namaari,

1009
01:05:47.781 --> 01:05:49.533
and offer her something nice
and go...

1010
01:05:49.700 --> 01:05:51.702
Hey! Wanna help us
save the world?

1011
01:05:51.869 --> 01:05:54.621
Because all it takes
is one gem piece.

1012
01:05:54.788 --> 01:05:56.081
Yes!

1013
01:05:56.164 --> 01:05:57.875
I've been waiting
for someone to ask me!

1014
01:05:58.041 --> 01:05:59.168
Here you go!

1015
01:05:59.543 --> 01:06:01.837
Best friends forever!

1016
01:06:04.590 --> 01:06:06.800
Yeah, I think I'd rather
go with Boun's plan.

1017
01:06:06.884 --> 01:06:07.885
What?

1018
01:06:07.968 --> 01:06:08.969
Yes!

1019
01:06:09.052 --> 01:06:10.053
What, why?

1020
01:06:10.137 --> 01:06:11.346
Because it's Fang.

1021
01:06:11.513 --> 01:06:13.640
Their blades
are specially designed

1022
01:06:13.724 --> 01:06:15.517
for the stabbing of backs.

1023
01:06:15.684 --> 01:06:16.727
If it weren't for them,

1024
01:06:16.810 --> 01:06:18.020
none of this
would have happened.

1025
01:06:18.187 --> 01:06:19.730
They're the worst.

1026
01:06:21.440 --> 01:06:23.108
If we're just honest with her,

1027
01:06:23.275 --> 01:06:24.693
deep down, I got a feeling

1028
01:06:24.776 --> 01:06:26.486
she wants to fix the world
as much as we do.

1029
01:06:26.653 --> 01:06:28.572
You weren't there
when Namaari betrayed me.

1030
01:06:28.906 --> 01:06:30.699
We're sticking with my plan.

1031
01:06:33.827 --> 01:06:36.079
Whoa. Uh...
What's with the downpour?

1032
01:06:36.246 --> 01:06:37.998
Come on!
I need to show you something.

1033
01:06:43.086 --> 01:06:45.088
So, what do we do now?

1034
01:06:45.380 --> 01:06:46.590
I don't know.

1035
01:06:47.216 --> 01:06:49.384
Where are you taking me?

1036
01:07:16.286 --> 01:07:18.413
Sisu, why did you
bring me here?

1037
01:07:18.622 --> 01:07:20.123
This is where it all happened.

1038
01:07:20.457 --> 01:07:22.251
Yeah, I know.

1039
01:07:23.627 --> 01:07:25.546
- I was there.
- No.

1040
01:07:26.380 --> 01:07:29.842
This is where it all happened
500 years ago.

1041
01:07:36.098 --> 01:07:38.892
I want you to meet
my brothers and sisters.

1042
01:07:39.268 --> 01:07:40.894
The real mighty ones.

1043
01:07:41.854 --> 01:07:43.146
I miss them.

1044
01:07:43.772 --> 01:07:45.649
I never knew
they were here.

1045
01:07:47.860 --> 01:07:49.695
See that classy-looking one
over there?

1046
01:07:50.070 --> 01:07:52.906
That's Amba.
I get my glow from her.

1047
01:07:53.073 --> 01:07:56.243
And that's Pranee.
She's a shapeshifter.

1048
01:07:56.827 --> 01:07:58.704
Jagan, fog.

1049
01:07:59.705 --> 01:08:01.540
And Pengu.

1050
01:08:02.499 --> 01:08:03.959
He's our big brother.

1051
01:08:04.960 --> 01:08:06.503
He brings the rain.

1052
01:08:07.254 --> 01:08:09.798
We were the last dragons.

1053
01:08:12.718 --> 01:08:15.053
All the other dragons
had been turned to stone.

1054
01:08:16.388 --> 01:08:18.015
We were drowning
in a sea of Druun.

1055
01:08:21.643 --> 01:08:25.731
But my oldest brother Pengu
refused to accept defeat.

1056
01:08:26.690 --> 01:08:29.026
This is where
we'd make our last stand...

1057
01:08:30.194 --> 01:08:31.403
united.

1058
01:08:35.324 --> 01:08:37.784
So, one by one,

1059
01:08:38.368 --> 01:08:41.038
they combined all their magic,

1060
01:08:41.205 --> 01:08:44.208
creating the Dragon Gem.

1061
01:08:49.296 --> 01:08:51.089
I don't know why
they chose me.

1062
01:08:52.174 --> 01:08:54.176
It could have been any of us.

1063
01:08:56.929 --> 01:08:58.472
All I know

1064
01:08:59.056 --> 01:09:00.641
is I trusted them...

1065
01:09:02.476 --> 01:09:04.144
...and they trusted me.

1066
01:09:06.563 --> 01:09:07.981
And so...

1067
01:09:18.242 --> 01:09:20.160
When they put their faith
in me,

1068
01:09:20.869 --> 01:09:23.622
it empowered me beyond
anything I could imagine.

1069
01:09:24.164 --> 01:09:26.291
The same can happen
with Namaari.

1070
01:09:27.167 --> 01:09:29.378
I really wish
I could believe that.

1071
01:09:29.878 --> 01:09:32.172
I once thought
that we could be friends.

1072
01:09:32.464 --> 01:09:33.549
After all this,

1073
01:09:34.091 --> 01:09:35.384
maybe you can be.

1074
01:09:36.093 --> 01:09:38.428
Even if she wanted to help us,

1075
01:09:39.012 --> 01:09:40.848
how could I possibly
trust her?

1076
01:09:41.014 --> 01:09:42.975
But if somehow you could,

1077
01:09:43.058 --> 01:09:44.935
you wouldn't just bring
your ba back.

1078
01:09:45.394 --> 01:09:47.229
You'd also bring back
his dream.

1079
01:09:47.688 --> 01:09:48.939
Kumandra.

1080
01:10:13.005 --> 01:10:15.132
Do you think
he would even recognize me?

1081
01:10:16.550 --> 01:10:17.843
So much has changed.

1082
01:10:20.137 --> 01:10:21.763
Of course he will.

1083
01:10:22.639 --> 01:10:24.099
You remind me of him.

1084
01:10:24.725 --> 01:10:26.143
Oh, yeah? Strong?

1085
01:10:26.226 --> 01:10:28.145
Good-looking
with impeccable hair?

1086
01:10:31.190 --> 01:10:32.608
Hopeful.

1087
01:10:36.820 --> 01:10:39.072
How would I even
approach Namaari

1088
01:10:39.156 --> 01:10:40.657
after all that's happened?

1089
01:10:41.116 --> 01:10:45.078
It may feel impossible,
but sometimes,

1090
01:10:45.245 --> 01:10:46.997
you just have to take
the first step,

1091
01:10:47.080 --> 01:10:48.248
even before you're ready.

1092
01:10:49.249 --> 01:10:50.292
Trust me.

1093
01:10:58.884 --> 01:11:01.011
Okay. We'll go with your plan.

1094
01:11:01.345 --> 01:11:03.805
What? My plan?
You're gonna go with my plan?

1095
01:11:03.889 --> 01:11:06.433
- Yeah.
- All right!

1096
01:11:06.600 --> 01:11:07.851
You're not gonna regret this.

1097
01:11:08.018 --> 01:11:09.520
But we're gonna need
a really good gift.

1098
01:11:09.686 --> 01:11:11.855
What do you think she's into?
Cats? Knives?

1099
01:11:12.064 --> 01:11:13.440
Cats with knives?

1100
01:11:13.524 --> 01:11:14.775
Knives with little cats
on them?

1101
01:11:14.858 --> 01:11:18.529
Actually, I know exactly what
to give her.

1102
01:11:23.575 --> 01:11:27.329
And that is how
the land of Fang rose

1103
01:11:27.496 --> 01:11:31.083
in spite of all the monsters
that wanted to destroy us.

1104
01:11:31.250 --> 01:11:34.711
Because we're smart, resilient,

1105
01:11:35.128 --> 01:11:36.505
and we take care of one another.

1106
01:11:36.672 --> 01:11:38.423
Mother! We need to talk.

1107
01:11:38.590 --> 01:11:39.716
It's Princess Namaari!

1108
01:11:41.009 --> 01:11:43.595
All right, all right,
now, run along, kittens.

1109
01:11:43.679 --> 01:11:45.973
I have to speak with the princess.

1110
01:11:46.139 --> 01:11:48.600
Mother, you won't believe what I saw.

1111
01:11:48.767 --> 01:11:50.394
You saw a dragon.

1112
01:11:51.436 --> 01:11:52.980
General Atitāya informed me

1113
01:11:53.146 --> 01:11:55.524
that you'd be returning home
without the gem pieces.

1114
01:11:55.691 --> 01:11:57.150
It was Sisu.

1115
01:11:57.317 --> 01:11:59.319
She can fix what we broke.

1116
01:11:59.486 --> 01:12:00.904
She can bring everyone back.

1117
01:12:01.071 --> 01:12:03.407
And that's what scares me.

1118
01:12:03.615 --> 01:12:05.284
When everyone comes back,

1119
01:12:05.367 --> 01:12:07.202
who do you think
they'll come for?

1120
01:12:07.327 --> 01:12:08.328
You forget.

1121
01:12:08.412 --> 01:12:10.747
The other lands blame us
for what's happened.

1122
01:12:10.914 --> 01:12:13.458
But we... We never meant
for anyone to get hurt.

1123
01:12:13.667 --> 01:12:17.004
Yes, but if we had the dragon

1124
01:12:17.171 --> 01:12:18.964
and the gem pieces,

1125
01:12:19.131 --> 01:12:21.008
we would be forgiven.

1126
01:12:21.175 --> 01:12:22.676
We could save the world.

1127
01:12:22.843 --> 01:12:25.971
But more importantly,
our people would remain safe.

1128
01:12:26.138 --> 01:12:28.682
But Raya isn't just gonna
give Sisu to us.

1129
01:12:29.850 --> 01:12:31.768
We're not going to give her
a choice.

1130
01:12:32.603 --> 01:12:34.229
What are you going to do?

1131
01:12:34.563 --> 01:12:36.690
That's no longer
your concern, my love.

1132
01:12:37.191 --> 01:12:38.525
You've done enough.

1133
01:12:49.912 --> 01:12:51.163
If she refuses to help,

1134
01:12:51.330 --> 01:12:53.415
we've just flushed
our tactical advantage

1135
01:12:53.582 --> 01:12:55.459
- into the dung pot.
- I know.

1136
01:12:55.626 --> 01:12:57.503
Yeah. She really has no reason
to help us.

1137
01:12:57.586 --> 01:12:58.587
I know!

1138
01:12:58.670 --> 01:12:59.880
This jerky's terrible.

1139
01:12:59.963 --> 01:13:00.964
I know!

1140
01:13:01.048 --> 01:13:03.217
Are you sure
those four miniature menaces

1141
01:13:03.300 --> 01:13:04.301
will be successful?

1142
01:13:04.510 --> 01:13:06.887
I don't know.

1143
01:13:17.898 --> 01:13:19.942
Huh?

1144
01:13:26.698 --> 01:13:27.741
Hmm?

1145
01:13:54.101 --> 01:13:55.102
Huh?

1146
01:14:21.128 --> 01:14:22.337
There's too much spice.

1147
01:14:22.421 --> 01:14:24.047
Uh, no.
There's too much bamboo.

1148
01:14:24.214 --> 01:14:25.215
What do you know?

1149
01:14:25.299 --> 01:14:26.508
You have the taste buds
of a tall baby.

1150
01:14:26.675 --> 01:14:28.302
Well, you dress like
a tall baby.

1151
01:14:28.468 --> 01:14:29.970
Give me the spoon!
I'm taking over!

1152
01:14:30.137 --> 01:14:32.264
Back off, tidal wave.
I'm the professional here.

1153
01:14:32.431 --> 01:14:33.724
May I?

1154
01:14:38.103 --> 01:14:39.104
Whoa!

1155
01:14:39.188 --> 01:14:40.189
That's good.

1156
01:14:40.314 --> 01:14:42.232
It's just a little
something my ba showed me.

1157
01:14:42.316 --> 01:14:43.859
Aw. Did he also show you

1158
01:14:43.942 --> 01:14:45.569
how to make
that delicious jerky?

1159
01:14:45.652 --> 01:14:47.821
No, that was all me.

1160
01:14:50.949 --> 01:14:53.160
It'll be nice to share a meal
with him again.

1161
01:14:53.368 --> 01:14:54.578
I know what you mean.

1162
01:14:55.287 --> 01:14:57.206
I have this really
obnoxious sister

1163
01:14:57.289 --> 01:14:58.874
who always tousles my hair.

1164
01:15:00.250 --> 01:15:02.002
I can't wait to see her
the most.

1165
01:15:02.169 --> 01:15:03.712
After we win the day,

1166
01:15:03.879 --> 01:15:06.256
I look forward
to filling my eyeball

1167
01:15:06.423 --> 01:15:11.678
with the joytastic image
of my village full again.

1168
01:15:13.555 --> 01:15:17.434
And you will be reunited
with your family, Noi.

1169
01:15:17.809 --> 01:15:19.811
Uh, what did you
just call her?

1170
01:15:19.978 --> 01:15:21.313
Noi. It's her name.

1171
01:15:22.481 --> 01:15:23.982
It's written on her collar.

1172
01:15:24.149 --> 01:15:26.068
Have none of you ever checked?

1173
01:15:26.276 --> 01:15:28.487
And they think of me
as the ruffian.

1174
01:15:33.033 --> 01:15:34.034
What's that mean?

1175
01:15:34.159 --> 01:15:35.160
It means we're on.

1176
01:15:36.328 --> 01:15:37.329
Sisu,

1177
01:15:37.496 --> 01:15:38.705
until we get that gem

1178
01:15:38.789 --> 01:15:41.250
and confirm Namaari's actually
on our side,

1179
01:15:41.500 --> 01:15:43.544
promise me you'll stay hidden.

1180
01:15:58.267 --> 01:16:00.143
I see you got my gift.

1181
01:16:01.228 --> 01:16:03.313
I never thought
I'd see this again.

1182
01:16:03.480 --> 01:16:04.982
Well, uh...

1183
01:16:05.148 --> 01:16:06.900
I tried to take
good care of it.

1184
01:16:09.361 --> 01:16:12.197
You're not the only
dragon nerd here.

1185
01:16:33.218 --> 01:16:34.428
The final piece.

1186
01:16:34.595 --> 01:16:36.513
Time to bring everyone back.

1187
01:16:42.394 --> 01:16:44.938
Sisu and the gem pieces
are coming with me.

1188
01:16:45.314 --> 01:16:46.773
- Sisu!
- Stay back!

1189
01:16:46.940 --> 01:16:49.484
It was foolish
to trust someone from Fang!

1190
01:16:49.651 --> 01:16:50.986
Don't come any closer!

1191
01:16:51.153 --> 01:16:52.154
Namaari,

1192
01:16:52.446 --> 01:16:54.531
it doesn't have to be
like this.

1193
01:16:54.698 --> 01:16:57.284
I don't have any other choice.

1194
01:16:57.951 --> 01:17:01.079
Hey. I got this.

1195
01:17:09.546 --> 01:17:11.465
I know you don't wanna
hurt anybody.

1196
01:17:11.632 --> 01:17:12.966
What are you doing?

1197
01:17:13.425 --> 01:17:15.135
You just want a better world.

1198
01:17:15.302 --> 01:17:17.179
Like we all do.

1199
01:17:17.971 --> 01:17:19.223
Sisu...

1200
01:17:20.849 --> 01:17:22.559
I trust you, Namaari.

1201
01:17:37.824 --> 01:17:39.076
No!

1202
01:17:42.579 --> 01:17:43.580
Sisu!

1203
01:17:49.127 --> 01:17:51.296
No...

1204
01:18:06.562 --> 01:18:08.355
What's happening?

1205
01:18:08.939 --> 01:18:10.315
I don't know.

1206
01:18:11.066 --> 01:18:13.318
It appears that
with the last dragon gone,

1207
01:18:13.402 --> 01:18:14.987
so too goes the water.

1208
01:18:16.029 --> 01:18:18.740
Now there is nothing
to stop the Druun.

1209
01:18:19.908 --> 01:18:21.243
Nothing.

1210
01:18:32.588 --> 01:18:33.589
Raya?

1211
01:18:34.590 --> 01:18:35.841
Where's Raya?

1212
01:19:11.001 --> 01:19:12.336
Namaari!

1213
01:19:13.462 --> 01:19:15.547
Let's finish this, binturi.

1214
01:19:40.989 --> 01:19:43.367
Raya!

1215
01:19:50.249 --> 01:19:51.708
She cannot see us.

1216
01:19:52.125 --> 01:19:54.711
Raya's blinded
by her own rage.

1217
01:19:56.088 --> 01:19:58.173
The gem's powers are fading!

1218
01:20:00.300 --> 01:20:01.760
All these people
are Druun food

1219
01:20:01.844 --> 01:20:02.970
if we don't get them out.

1220
01:20:06.390 --> 01:20:09.393
Come on!
Trust me, it's gonna be okay.

1221
01:20:10.686 --> 01:20:12.813
Stupid Druun! Out of my way!

1222
01:20:12.980 --> 01:20:14.231
Go, go, go!

1223
01:20:15.524 --> 01:20:17.484
Up we go! Yep!

1224
01:20:27.744 --> 01:20:29.079
Go, go! Hurry!

1225
01:20:29.413 --> 01:20:32.249
Get to the water!
Keep going! Keep going!

1226
01:20:36.086 --> 01:20:38.088
Come on! Come on!

1227
01:21:24.301 --> 01:21:26.220
I never meant
for any of this to happen.

1228
01:21:26.386 --> 01:21:27.596
Liar!

1229
01:21:29.056 --> 01:21:31.099
I don't care
if you believe me.

1230
01:21:31.892 --> 01:21:32.935
Sisu did.

1231
01:21:34.478 --> 01:21:35.979
But you didn't trust her.

1232
01:21:37.564 --> 01:21:39.149
That's why we're here.

1233
01:21:40.275 --> 01:21:41.818
Do whatever you want.

1234
01:21:42.486 --> 01:21:45.614
But you're as much to blame
for Sisu's death as I am.

1235
01:21:55.207 --> 01:21:56.583
Tong, there's still
people back there!

1236
01:21:56.750 --> 01:21:58.293
Hurry!
We're running out of time!

1237
01:21:58.377 --> 01:21:59.419
Got it!

1238
01:21:59.503 --> 01:22:01.755
Everyone, out! Come with me!

1239
01:22:36.582 --> 01:22:38.083
Okay, Tuk,
these are the last of 'em.

1240
01:22:38.250 --> 01:22:39.960
Go! We're right behind you.

1241
01:22:41.461 --> 01:22:42.462
Tuk Tuk!

1242
01:22:45.591 --> 01:22:47.050
What are you waiting for? Go!

1243
01:22:54.766 --> 01:22:56.018
Raya!

1244
01:22:57.186 --> 01:22:59.730
It's the one who slayed Sisu!

1245
01:23:11.742 --> 01:23:14.161
Raya! Raya!

1246
01:23:14.328 --> 01:23:16.205
The gem's magic,
it's almost gone!

1247
01:23:16.371 --> 01:23:18.040
They aren't backing off!

1248
01:23:18.207 --> 01:23:19.750
They're everywhere!

1249
01:23:44.274 --> 01:23:46.276
I don't know why
they chose me.

1250
01:23:47.694 --> 01:23:49.238
It could have been any of us.

1251
01:23:50.322 --> 01:23:53.116
All I know is I trusted them,

1252
01:23:53.659 --> 01:23:55.452
and they trusted me.

1253
01:23:56.286 --> 01:23:57.746
And so...

1254
01:24:00.624 --> 01:24:02.251
Everyone, give me your gems.

1255
01:24:02.376 --> 01:24:04.711
We can still put it together.
It can still work.

1256
01:24:04.795 --> 01:24:07.422
Sisu's gone, Raya!
We don't have her magic!

1257
01:24:07.506 --> 01:24:10.384
It's not about her magic.
It's about trust.

1258
01:24:10.467 --> 01:24:11.510
What?

1259
01:24:11.593 --> 01:24:14.346
That's why it worked.
That's why we can do it, too.

1260
01:24:14.513 --> 01:24:17.474
By doing the one thing
Sisu wanted us to do.

1261
01:24:17.641 --> 01:24:19.685
What my ba wanted us to do.

1262
01:24:19.852 --> 01:24:22.729
To finally trust each other
and fix this.

1263
01:24:23.897 --> 01:24:26.400
But we have to come together.

1264
01:24:26.567 --> 01:24:27.734
Please.

1265
01:24:27.901 --> 01:24:29.695
After what she's done?

1266
01:24:29.778 --> 01:24:31.238
We'll never trust her!

1267
01:24:37.035 --> 01:24:38.745
Then let me take
the first step.

1268
01:24:50.048 --> 01:24:51.175
Raya! No!

1269
01:28:12.042 --> 01:28:14.545
It worked! It worked!

1270
01:29:00.215 --> 01:29:02.509
Tuk Tuk!

1271
01:29:03.135 --> 01:29:04.219
Oh!

1272
01:30:21.880 --> 01:30:23.423
Pranee! Amba!

1273
01:30:23.632 --> 01:30:24.633
Jagan!

1274
01:30:24.842 --> 01:30:26.468
Pengu!

1275
01:30:26.552 --> 01:30:28.929
Yeah!

1276
01:31:00.252 --> 01:31:01.253
Raya.

1277
01:31:02.462 --> 01:31:03.630
Sisu.

1278
01:31:04.464 --> 01:31:07.885
I am so hungry.

1279
01:31:08.510 --> 01:31:09.887
I got some jerky.

1280
01:31:10.429 --> 01:31:11.638
Not that hungry.

1281
01:31:20.898 --> 01:31:22.524
Sisu!

1282
01:31:22.608 --> 01:31:26.862
Aw, it's good to breathe in
your glorious dragon stench again.

1283
01:31:26.945 --> 01:31:28.572
Okay, I take that
as a compliment.

1284
01:32:18.830 --> 01:32:19.957
Momma!

1285
01:32:20.040 --> 01:32:21.542
My baby!

1286
01:32:25.003 --> 01:32:26.171
Mom, look, it's Boun!

1287
01:32:28.298 --> 01:32:29.424
It's Boun!

1288
01:33:08.922 --> 01:33:10.132
Ba?

1289
01:33:14.595 --> 01:33:16.263
Dewdrop?

1290
01:33:19.057 --> 01:33:20.058
Ba!

1291
01:33:37.284 --> 01:33:38.744
Is that really her?

1292
01:33:42.706 --> 01:33:46.502
Chief Benja,
your daughter did you proud.

1293
01:33:47.294 --> 01:33:50.255
Hope you don't mind,
she brought some friends.

1294
01:34:18.909 --> 01:34:20.536
Ba?

1295
01:34:21.203 --> 01:34:23.956
Welcome to Kumandra.

1296
01:35:17.176 --> 01:35:19.011
We have a choice

1297
01:35:19.094 --> 01:35:21.346
To build or destroy

1298
01:35:21.430 --> 01:35:26.185
To fight or to come together

1299
01:35:26.685 --> 01:35:28.478
Love is a bridge

1300
01:35:28.562 --> 01:35:30.898
And trust is a gift

1301
01:35:30.981 --> 01:35:36.195
We give it
And it gets better

1302
01:35:36.278 --> 01:35:38.655
There's an energy
in the water

1303
01:35:38.739 --> 01:35:41.033
There is magic
deep in our heart

1304
01:35:41.116 --> 01:35:43.285
There's a legacy
that we honor

1305
01:35:43.368 --> 01:35:45.621
When we bring
the light to the dark

1306
01:35:45.704 --> 01:35:48.248
Whatever brings us together

1307
01:35:48.332 --> 01:35:50.626
Can never tear us apart

1308
01:35:50.709 --> 01:35:53.086
We become stronger than ever

1309
01:35:53.170 --> 01:35:55.005
When we just trust

1310
01:35:55.088 --> 01:35:57.799
Trust and believe it
You'll see that

1311
01:35:57.883 --> 01:35:59.718
We’ll lead the way

When you're broken

1319
01:36:15.359 --> 01:36:17.986
Open up your heart and feel

1320
01:36:18.070 --> 01:36:22.574
There's no difference
We're all family here

1321
01:36:23.116 --> 01:36:25.452
Despite all of our doubts

1322
01:36:25.536 --> 01:36:27.788
All our up and downs

1323
01:36:27.871 --> 01:36:33.085
There's never really
anything to fear

1324
01:36:33.585 --> 01:36:35.796
There's an energy
in the water

1325
01:36:35.879 --> 01:36:37.965
There is magic
deep in our heart

1326
01:36:38.048 --> 01:36:40.551
There's a legacy
that we honor

1327
01:36:40.634 --> 01:36:43.178
When we bring the light
to the dark

1328
01:36:43.262 --> 01:36:45.514
Whatever brings us together

1329
01:36:45.597 --> 01:36:47.766
Can never tear us apart

1330
01:36:47.850 --> 01:36:50.269
We become stronger than ever

1331
01:36:50.352 --> 01:36:52.104
When we just trust

1332
01:36:52.187 --> 01:36:54.648
Trust and believe it
You'll see that

1333
01:36:54.731 --> 01:36:56.692
We’ll lead the way

Takin' my first step

1341
01:37:22.968 --> 01:37:25.429
I see you as myself

1342
01:37:25.512 --> 01:37:30.184
Nothing we can't do

1343
01:37:30.267 --> 01:37:32.769
Put the past behind

1344
01:37:32.853 --> 01:37:35.105
Learn from life this time

1345
01:37:35.189 --> 01:37:40.110
We can start brand new

1346
01:37:40.194 --> 01:37:42.571
There's an energy
in the water

1347
