2
00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:41.116
Hey, hey, hey!

3
00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:42.760
What the fuck?

4
00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:46.031
Wait! I gotta call it in!

5
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.035
Move it!

6
00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:00.075
Hey!

7
00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.079
Bobby, you hear me?

8
00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.319
Right there, motherfucker!

9
00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:29.839
Please.

10
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.831
Just fucking stop, man!

11
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.513
Just put the gun down!

12
00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:38.796
Come on.

13
00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:39.995
Please.

14
00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.598
I'm fucking begging you.

15
00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:45.354
I didn't touch him.
I didn't touch that old man!

16
00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:47.000
I wasn't even...

17
00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:14.759
Worse on Friday
Died on Saturday

18
00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:16.035
Buried on Sunday

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:18.959
That was the end
Of Solomon Grundy

Born on a Monday

21
00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:23.478
Christened on Tuesday

22
00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:27.950
Justine, please.

23
00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:34.233
It's called "stimming,"
self-stimulation.

24
00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.912
Whereas you and I might tap our fingers,

25
00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:40.548
grind our teeth, bite our nails,

26
00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:42.478
your son rocks back and forth.

27
00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:45.433
It's more obvious, but perfectly natural.

28
00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:49.076
We came here because
we heard you specialized in...

29
00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:51.117
What is it? What does he have?

30
00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:53.919
I'm not a fan of labels, ma'am.

31
00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:57.273
Your son is a remarkable young man.

32
00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:00.193
Who goes crazy
when you turn the vacuum on.

33
00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:03.432
He wears one T-shirt,
won't let you hug him.

34
00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:05.431
Loud noises, bright lights

35
00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:08.910
can be especially difficult
for someone like your son.

36
00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:12.317
The shirt, most likely fabric sensitivity.

37
00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:15.597
Hugging,
closeness, touching...

38
00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:16.880
Justine, no shoes today.

39
00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:18.656
That can be a challenge, yes.

40
00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:20.520
When it's somebody else's child,

41
00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:22.198
it's a challenge.

42
00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:24.358
When it's yours,

43
00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:25.794
it's a problem.

44
00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:29.678
My practice focuses on education.

45
00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:32.308
I'd like to work with your son,
at his speed.

46
00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:36.196
Help him develop the skills
he'll need to lead a full life.

47
00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:38.118
Communicating, eye contact,

48
00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:40.231
understanding non-verbal cues,

49
00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:41.833
making friends.

50
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.798
The only friend
he has is his little brother.

51
00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:48.313
I'm sure moving from base to base
hasn 't helped.

52
00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:52.993
My husband's in the Army,
which means we all are.

53
00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:57.152
Would you be willing to let your son
stay with us for the summer

54
00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:00.915
free of charge, working with me
in a sensory-friendly environment?

55
00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:02.718
That's not gonna happen.

56
00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:05.988
If loud noises and bright lights
bother him,

57
00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:08.549
he needs more of it, not less.

58
00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:12.357
The world is not
a sensory-friendly place,

59
00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:14.676
and that's where
he needs to learn to live.

60
00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:17.748
Not in here.

61
00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:20.033
Doctor, in your opinion,

62
00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:23.393
can our son lead a normal life?

63
00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:26.236
Define normal.

64
00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:28.511
I need to finish! I need to finish!

75
00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:09.720
Hmm. Mmm.

76
00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:31.072
I, uh... I never thought of myself
as a quitter... Fourth-generation farmer.

77
00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:36.629
But between the property taxes

78
00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:39.754
and the fertilizer costs, and insurance...

79
00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:46.075
Oh, to hell with it.

80
00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:48.635
What if, just temporarily, mind you,

81
00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:51.633
we put this year's taxes
on our credit card?

82
00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:59.359
Do you like it?

83
00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:00.873
I made it myself.

84
00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:02.598
No, not particularly.

85
00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:04.959
But do you ever sell them?

86
00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:06.599
At church fairs now and again.

87
00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:09.712
Mrs. Rice, you may have what the IRS
calls a "home-based business."

88
00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:12.040
What room do you use in your house
when you make those?

89
00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:13.195
I don't, really.

90
00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:14.998
Just wherever I happen to be, I guess.

91
00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:17.628
In front of the TV,
at the kitchen table.

92
00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:20.176
I like to spread my beads out
in the dining room, but Frank gets...

93
00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:22.475
Yes, it would be better
if you could try to remember

94
00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:24.949
the one specific space that you use.

95
00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:27.316
Your home is 2,913 square feet.

96
00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:30.478
IRS code allows us to deduct
from your taxable income

97
00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:33.313
a percentage of your workspace
relative to your overall home.

98
00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:34.640
- What...
- Mr. Rice...

99
00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:36.518
How big is your dining room?

100
00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:38.388
Mrs. Rice's office.

101
00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:40.880
I wouldn't
so much as call it an office...

102
00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:42.440
Oh.

103
00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:46.395
It's, uh, approximately 200, uh...

104
00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:53.996
Well, make it 300 square feet.

105
00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:55.673
Excellent. Mrs. Rice...

106
00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:56.909
Dolores.

107
00:06:57.080 --> 00:07:00.436
Dolores, when you order supplies,
do you order online?

108
00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:02.989
I don't. I just zip on over
to the bead store.

109
00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:04.388
Zip?

110
00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:07.148
I drive the truck.

111
00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:09.558
The company truck.

112
00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:29.349
Come in.

113
00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:33.656
Mr. King, you have wandered

114
00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:35.272
so far outside your legal purview.

115
00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:36.998
As president of Southern Gulf Bank,

116
00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:39.720
I intend to protect
my customers' privacy...

117
00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:40.915
Stop talking.

118
00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:43.520
You have a very cavalier attitude
for the president of a bank,

119
00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:45.080
with such a piss-poor capital cushion.

120
00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:48.716
Now, I want a record of every transaction
Abayed has had for the past two years.

121
00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:51.553
Deposits, withdrawals,
cashier's checks, credit cards.

122
00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:54.871
Birmingham or Bahrain,
it is now Treasury business.

123
00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:56.393
Goodbye.

124
00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:58.073
Medina.

125
00:07:58.240 --> 00:07:59.593
Am I saying that correctly?

126
00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:00.875
Medina, yes, sir.

127
00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:04.238
I've read all your case files,
Director King.

128
00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:07.073
It's impressive work. Very.

129
00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:10.391
Marybeth Ascension Medina.

130
00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:12.915
Graduated University of Baltimore
cum laude

131
00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:15.116
with a degree in criminal justice.

132
00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:19.831
Two years Baltimore PD as an analyst,
two more at Homeland, analyst again,

133
00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:23.789
and the last five years here at Treasury.

134
00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:25.154
Analyst.

135
00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:29.676
You did the heavy lifting
on Agent Lorenz's case last month.

136
00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:32.431
I worked on it, yeah, but Agent Lorenz...

137
00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:35.273
Why haven't you applied
for promotion to agent?

138
00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:37.273
You're already doing the work.

139
00:08:38.280 --> 00:08:39.918
Analyst is a good fit.

140
00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:43.112
And I enjoy the work, so...

141
00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:47.672
Well, you're a liar, Medina.

142
00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:52.393
Ward of the state of Maryland's

143
00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:54.835
foster care
and juvenile detention systems

144
00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.116
from age 11 to 18.

145
00:08:57.280 --> 00:09:00.272
Weapons charges, assault and battery.

146
00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:02.189
Ouch.

147
00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:04.191
Attempted murder.

148
00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:09.558
Those records were sealed.

149
00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:13.552
Is that a nine millimeter?

150
00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:16.629
.45.

151
00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:20.156
You better sit your ass
back down in that chair, young lady.

152
00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.150
This is a big moment for you.

153
00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:26.237
Make a good choice.

154
00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:41.314
Lying on a federal employment application
is a felony.

155
00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:48.997
So right now, I'm the only thing standing
between you and significant prison time.

156
00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:54.157
What do you want?

157
00:09:54.920 --> 00:09:57.992
Do you like puzzles, Marybeth Medina?

158
00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:04.511
I meant what I said, son.
You're welcome out to the place anytime.

159
00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:06.318
Do you fish? I got a two-acre pond

160
00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:08.016
that is just thick with catfish and bass...

161
00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:10.349
I don't fish. I shoot.

162
00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:14.195
Well, the farm's a perfect place
to do a little plinkin', so...

163
00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:16.040
Well...

164
00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:18.069
Thank you.

165
00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:20.712
You take care, son.

166
00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:21.949
Thank you.

167
00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:29.472
My daughter's meeting me for lunch.
I think you two just might hit it off.

168
00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:31.039
Nice to see you.

169
00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:34.789
Already enhanced.

170
00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:38.236
Was taken three years ago in Antwerp
by an undercover Interpol agent.

171
00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:40.277
Their target's on the far right.

172
00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:41.874
Yeah, Zalmay Atta.

173
00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:43.635
Go on.

174
00:10:44.280 --> 00:10:46.714
Ran the world's largest opium pipeline.

175
00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:49.394
Ties to Karzai and Ghani, Taliban.

176
00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:51.994
I mean, he was considered untouchable.

177
00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:54.390
Look at the rest. Tell me what you see.

178
00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:05.912
Yeah, I remember most of these arrests.
They were huge.

179
00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:08.230
Focus. They're not all arrests.

180
00:11:22.280 --> 00:11:23.759
It's the same man.

181
00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:25.353
"Lou Carroll."

182
00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:28.911
For what it's worth, it's an alias.

183
00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:31.190
The Hong Kong photo
goes back about five years.

184
00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:33.954
In that one, he's "Carl Gauss."

185
00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:39.437
Tokyo, Tel Aviv, Naples.
There was a sighting in Tehran.

186
00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:41.511
All describing the same man.
"An accountant."

187
00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:44.109
"Our accountant." "The accountant."

188
00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:47.397
The accountant, like CPA accountant?

189
00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:50.475
Okay.

190
00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:53.634
Say you're the head of the Sinaloa Cartel.

191
00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:56.355
Now, the cartels count their money

192
00:11:56.520 --> 00:11:58.670
by weighing it in 18-wheelers.

193
00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:01.117
But one sunny Mexican day,

194
00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:04.949
your in-house money scrubber comes to you
and says you're 30 million light.

195
00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:07.390
Who can you trust to do
the forensic accounting,

196
00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:09.312
track your stolen cash?

197
00:12:09.480 --> 00:12:11.675
Deloitte and Touche? H&R Block?

198
00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:14.631
You somehow

199
00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:17.678
contact an individual
capable of coming in cold,

200
00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:20.155
un-cooking years of books,

201
00:12:20.840 --> 00:12:22.831
and getting out alive.

202
00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:24.798
I retire in seven months.

203
00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:29.670
Before I do, I need to know
who he is, how he does it.

204
00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:32.400
I mean, who survives
this kind of clientele?

205
00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:34.591
The secrets this guy has.

206
00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:39.400
What exactly do you want me to do?

207
00:12:40.280 --> 00:12:42.157
Report directly to me.

208
00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:43.839
No other case work.

209
00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.355
No other Treasury personnel involved.

210
00:12:46.920 --> 00:12:50.117
At the end of the month,
one of two things will have occurred.

211
00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:53.031
Resolution of this case,

212
00:12:56.120 --> 00:12:58.395
or we update your photo.

213
00:14:37.560 --> 00:14:39.790
You want it your way?
You got it!

214
00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:47.958
Mom! Mom! Mom!

215
00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:50.315
Mom! Why is Mom leaving? Mom!

216
00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:52.278
Mom! Mom!

217
00:14:53.720 --> 00:14:55.631
- I just got home.
- You're always...

218
00:15:05.720 --> 00:15:06.720
Mom! Why are you leaving?

219
00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:08.136
I'm just asking you to stay.

220
00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:09.456
- Just, please stay.
- We had help!

221
00:15:09.480 --> 00:15:11.520
- Stay here! Don't go anywhere!
- You threw it away!

222
00:15:16.440 --> 00:15:17.555
No. Hey.

223
00:15:23.280 --> 00:15:24.349
That's it.

224
00:15:24.520 --> 00:15:25.880
Please don't leave...

225
00:15:26.080 --> 00:15:27.736
Mom!

226
00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:29.280
Here we go, here we go.

227
00:15:29.680 --> 00:15:30.680
Here we go.

228
00:15:32.360 --> 00:15:38.037
Solomon Grundy
Born on a Monday

229
00:15:38.200 --> 00:15:42.034
Christened on Tuesday
Married on a Wednesday

230
00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:44.350
Sick on Thursday

231
00:15:46.560 --> 00:15:49.393
Died on a Saturday
Buried on Sunday

232
00:15:49.560 --> 00:15:52.950
- That was the end of Solomon Grundy
- That was the end of Solomon Grundy

233
00:15:53.120 --> 00:15:54.792
Do it again.

234
00:15:54.960 --> 00:15:57.872
Solomon Grundy
Born on a Monday

235
00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:40.239
Looks like somebody's seen
too many westerns.

236
00:16:41.440 --> 00:16:42.953
Yeah, must be what...

237
00:16:44.760 --> 00:16:46.113
A mile out?

238
00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:50.351
Not on my best day...

239
00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:05.753
Holy shit.

240
00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:40.756
Okay, listen to me.

241
00:18:40.920 --> 00:18:44.799
In-flec-tion. Right?
Listen, just listen to my tone.

242
00:18:44.960 --> 00:18:47.793
I say, "Oh, I'm another year older,

243
00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:51.555
"and I don't know if I'm ever gonna
get out of this fucking place."

244
00:18:51.720 --> 00:18:53.199
And you say...

245
00:18:53.400 --> 00:18:55.176
You're probably right, Francis.
You're extremely old.

246
00:18:55.200 --> 00:18:56.696
- It's unlikely you'll survive to...
- No. No...

247
00:18:56.720 --> 00:18:58.870
No. Hold on. That's not what you say.

248
00:18:59.440 --> 00:19:02.034
Two years together
every night, you know.

249
00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:05.277
I gave you a PhD in black money,
but you gotta learn this.

250
00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:07.158
- This is crucial.
- You're frustrated.

251
00:19:07.320 --> 00:19:08.600
- What am I?
- You're frustrated.

252
00:19:09.560 --> 00:19:10.709
That's what I am.

253
00:19:10.920 --> 00:19:12.478
I'm frustrated. Good, good. Excellent.

254
00:19:12.920 --> 00:19:14.956
Finally. All right. Let's do another one.

255
00:19:16.560 --> 00:19:19.757
Lights out, ladies.
Lights out.

256
00:19:20.920 --> 00:19:22.720
Names and addresses. Go.

257
00:19:23.560 --> 00:19:26.996
Semion Ivankov.
79 Primorsky Boulevard, Odessa.

258
00:19:27.160 --> 00:19:31.756
The Meier brothers, Moshe and Itzhak.
221 She'arim Boulevard in Jerusalem.

259
00:19:31.920 --> 00:19:34.673
Dominic Rabito of
960 Court Street, Brooklyn.

260
00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:36.068
Ask for Bobby.

261
00:19:36.320 --> 00:19:37.469
Ask for Bobby.

262
00:19:37.800 --> 00:19:38.880
You know, I'm old.

263
00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:42.276
I may be remembering things
a little rosier than they were.

264
00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:46.519
I mean, you want to fill out 1040s
and itemize deductions,

265
00:19:46.680 --> 00:19:48.760
and pull in 50 grand a year?
I mean, that's a living.

266
00:19:48.920 --> 00:19:51.673
Because if you go down
this road, this road...

267
00:19:51.840 --> 00:19:55.355
You can't go back, you understand?
It's dangerous. Do you understand?

268
00:19:55.520 --> 00:19:56.589
I understand.

269
00:19:56.760 --> 00:19:59.433
You find one person
you can trust, just one.

270
00:19:59.600 --> 00:20:03.479
And do not make my mistake.
You keep moving your ass around.

271
00:20:12.200 --> 00:20:14.191
They gave me a new handler today.

272
00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:17.789
I don't like this guy. He's dull.

273
00:20:19.560 --> 00:20:20.788
Worried.

274
00:20:24.880 --> 00:20:26.313
Ah, fuck it.

275
00:20:28.680 --> 00:20:30.352
Good night, son.

276
00:20:31.720 --> 00:20:33.392
Good night, Francis.

277
00:20:41.320 --> 00:20:43.550
What about Zurich? Saudi Arabia?

278
00:20:43.760 --> 00:20:45.096
The Swiss are cheap.

279
00:20:45.120 --> 00:20:47.520
Dubai is one thing, but we're
too conspicuous in the Kingdom.

280
00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:48.715
I vote Chicago.

281
00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:51.872
- Why?
- There's an uptick in online chatter.

282
00:20:52.040 --> 00:20:53.189
People looking for you.

283
00:20:53.360 --> 00:20:55.510
- What people?
- The unfriendly kind.

284
00:20:55.960 --> 00:20:57.996
Let's try a legitimate client for once.

285
00:20:58.160 --> 00:21:01.914
No cartels, arms brokers,
money launderers, assassins.

286
00:21:02.360 --> 00:21:04.920
I like safe. I like you safe.

287
00:21:05.080 --> 00:21:06.600
Everyone's hiding something.

288
00:21:06.680 --> 00:21:08.432
At least there's honor among thieves.

289
00:21:08.600 --> 00:21:11.751
There's honor among Illinois
electronics manufacturers.

290
00:21:12.560 --> 00:21:16.678
They're in your current backyard.
No risk of movement. You'll meet?

291
00:21:17.640 --> 00:21:18.709
Yeah, I'll meet.

292
00:21:19.280 --> 00:21:20.918
One last piece of business.

293
00:21:21.080 --> 00:21:22.229
Just the Renoir.

294
00:21:22.400 --> 00:21:24.120
I don't have
a buyer for the Renoir.

295
00:21:24.280 --> 00:21:27.352
The Pollock can move.
Will you ever let it go?

296
00:21:29.760 --> 00:21:30.760
Hello?

297
00:21:30.920 --> 00:21:33.354
Just the Renoir. Drop the price.

298
00:21:34.880 --> 00:21:36.233
Heavy sigh.

299
00:21:38.120 --> 00:21:40.270
Go to work, dreamboat.

300
00:21:47.920 --> 00:21:50.753
Now, Mr. Wolff, I half-suspect
we're wasting your time.

301
00:21:50.920 --> 00:21:52.433
I'm quite sure you're not.

302
00:21:52.600 --> 00:21:54.113
And you know this how?

303
00:21:54.280 --> 00:21:55.872
I'm on the clock.

304
00:21:56.840 --> 00:21:58.068
Shit.

305
00:21:58.240 --> 00:22:00.071
I hope we're not wasting ours then.

306
00:22:01.400 --> 00:22:05.393
Look, kidding aside, I think if you
saw our books, you'd run for the hills.

307
00:22:06.760 --> 00:22:09.274
We have an incredibly complicated
accounting system.

308
00:22:09.440 --> 00:22:11.908
Depreciation schedules
on hundreds of different items.

309
00:22:12.080 --> 00:22:13.957
Full-time and contract employees.

310
00:22:14.120 --> 00:22:16.111
Department of Defense classified accounts.

311
00:22:16.280 --> 00:22:17.429
It's a numerical shitstorm.

312
00:22:17.600 --> 00:22:20.433
I'll need to see all those books
for the past 10 years.

313
00:22:20.600 --> 00:22:23.239
Bank statements, complete list
of clients and vendors.

314
00:22:23.440 --> 00:22:26.352
Hard copies printed out, my eyes only.
All the information's right here.

315
00:22:26.600 --> 00:22:27.828
Okay, well, well, look.

316
00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:30.833
This all came to my attention
only last week.

317
00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:33.958
Now, a junior cost accountant
stuck her nose where it didn't belong,

318
00:22:34.160 --> 00:22:36.151
and obviously had no idea
what she was looking at.

319
00:22:36.440 --> 00:22:38.590
Lamar's overreacting.
There's no missing money.

320
00:22:38.760 --> 00:22:41.115
How long have you been CFO
of this company, sir?

321
00:22:41.280 --> 00:22:42.349
15 years.

322
00:22:42.520 --> 00:22:44.556
I need the books for the past 15, please.

323
00:22:45.120 --> 00:22:47.111
Well, you're awful goddamn blunt!

324
00:22:47.280 --> 00:22:49.794
I'm Lamar Blackburn's oldest friend.

325
00:22:49.960 --> 00:22:50.960
I've been by his side

326
00:22:51.120 --> 00:22:54.430
since he was turning out RC robots
that RadioShack called crap.

327
00:22:54.800 --> 00:22:57.109
I wouldn't take a dime without his say-so.

328
00:22:57.960 --> 00:22:59.029
You're angry.

329
00:22:59.200 --> 00:23:00.519
Oh, this is bullshit.

330
00:23:01.320 --> 00:23:04.312
Unusual way of making contact with you,
Mr. Wolff.

331
00:23:05.960 --> 00:23:07.951
You were recommended by Mansoor Haqqani.

332
00:23:08.120 --> 00:23:10.509
We custom-made prosthetics
for his youngest daughter.

333
00:23:11.160 --> 00:23:12.912
You may know that she lost both legs

334
00:23:13.120 --> 00:23:15.634
to a car bomb
outside his investment firm in Lahore.

335
00:23:16.560 --> 00:23:20.473
He told my brother, Lamar, that you were
nothing short of supernatural.

336
00:23:22.080 --> 00:23:26.039
Mr. Haqqani holds advanced degrees
in mathematics from Cambridge

337
00:23:26.200 --> 00:23:28.031
and Caltech.

338
00:23:28.760 --> 00:23:30.990
Why does a man like that need you?

339
00:23:32.080 --> 00:23:34.355
I don't discuss client business.

340
00:25:05.520 --> 00:25:08.512
What do you suppose that young man
is thinking right now?

341
00:25:09.760 --> 00:25:11.751
"Why do I still feel my arm?"

342
00:25:11.920 --> 00:25:13.148
I don't know.

343
00:25:13.360 --> 00:25:16.670
"How did everything go so wrong,
so fast?"

344
00:25:17.520 --> 00:25:20.193
"It's cold. Turn up the heat."

345
00:25:22.320 --> 00:25:23.594
Christian Wolff, I presume.

346
00:25:23.760 --> 00:25:24.760
Mr. Blackburn.

347
00:25:24.960 --> 00:25:26.188
Lamar.

348
00:25:26.640 --> 00:25:27.789
Lamar.

349
00:25:30.120 --> 00:25:31.269
Come with me.

350
00:25:33.440 --> 00:25:37.115
Are you aware of Living Robotics'
three income streams?

351
00:25:37.280 --> 00:25:39.589
Consumer electronics,
next generation prosthetics,

352
00:25:39.760 --> 00:25:41.273
unmanned military applications.

353
00:25:41.480 --> 00:25:44.358
Prosthetics division showed tremendous
growth over the last 10 years.

354
00:25:44.560 --> 00:25:45.879
It seems to have matured.

355
00:25:46.040 --> 00:25:49.669
Consumer products is your highest source
of revenue, followed closely

356
00:25:49.840 --> 00:25:52.718
by Defense Department contracts
and prosthetics at two and three.

357
00:25:52.880 --> 00:25:55.792
Yeah. You are well-informed.

358
00:26:00.240 --> 00:26:01.389
I never married.

359
00:26:01.560 --> 00:26:03.039
Never had kids.

360
00:26:03.200 --> 00:26:05.316
This company is my child.

361
00:26:05.560 --> 00:26:08.154
That said,
money has never been a motivation.

362
00:26:08.320 --> 00:26:11.995
Balance sheets,
profit and loss statements...

363
00:26:12.840 --> 00:26:15.308
My mind doesn't function
the way yours must.

364
00:26:16.200 --> 00:26:19.033
I need you to be my eyes and ears, Chris.

365
00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:22.954
Whatever you need to do your job,
you let me know.

366
00:26:27.080 --> 00:26:28.832
I'll start in the morning.

367
00:26:45.360 --> 00:26:47.191
Son of a bitch.

368
00:26:56.080 --> 00:26:57.274
Bloody hell.

369
00:27:01.760 --> 00:27:02.909
Excuse me...

370
00:27:03.280 --> 00:27:05.555
Who the fuck do you think you are?

371
00:27:05.720 --> 00:27:07.551
Do you know who the fuck I am?

372
00:27:08.200 --> 00:27:09.713
Simon Dewey.

373
00:27:10.560 --> 00:27:13.552
Founder, CEO, Dewey Capital.

374
00:27:14.200 --> 00:27:16.953
American. Shocking.

375
00:27:17.600 --> 00:27:20.034
I have kidnap insurance.
You obviously know that.

376
00:27:20.240 --> 00:27:22.016
Sorry, but how in the world
would I know that you have...

377
00:27:22.040 --> 00:27:23.553
You people fucking amaze me...

378
00:27:25.240 --> 00:27:28.152
When you interrupt somebody like that,
it makes them feel

379
00:27:28.320 --> 00:27:31.073
that you're just not interested
in what they have to say.

380
00:27:31.240 --> 00:27:32.960
Or maybe you just think
what you have to say

381
00:27:33.080 --> 00:27:35.071
is more important than what I have to say.

382
00:27:35.240 --> 00:27:36.958
Is that what you think?

383
00:27:39.400 --> 00:27:42.870
That gun makes you a big man, does it?

384
00:27:44.240 --> 00:27:46.800
This gun? Simon, come on.

385
00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:53.118
I'm part of a small but potent department
of a private security force.

386
00:27:53.280 --> 00:27:56.636
We have a client, let's call it
a European manufacturing concern.

387
00:27:56.800 --> 00:27:59.268
You're shorting their stock,
but simultaneously,

388
00:27:59.440 --> 00:28:02.113
you're spreading false rumors
regarding the health of the company.

389
00:28:02.320 --> 00:28:05.949
The resulting decline in the stock price,
it's made you your millions,

390
00:28:06.160 --> 00:28:07.912
but it's been at my client's expense.

391
00:28:08.120 --> 00:28:10.475
They have been forced
to cut hundreds of jobs, Simon.

392
00:28:10.640 --> 00:28:14.110
These are third-generation metal workers,
people with families.

393
00:28:14.280 --> 00:28:16.840
Pensions are being rendered worthless
because of you.

394
00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:19.958
But you'll stop now. Correct?

395
00:28:20.960 --> 00:28:21.960
Which company?

396
00:28:22.320 --> 00:28:23.469
Wrong answer, Simon.

397
00:28:23.680 --> 00:28:24.795
Look, genius...

398
00:28:26.520 --> 00:28:27.640
That's the same spot, Simon.

399
00:28:27.760 --> 00:28:30.115
Why you gonna let me hit you
in the same exact spot?

400
00:28:30.280 --> 00:28:31.395
I only meant

401
00:28:31.800 --> 00:28:33.791
we hold short positions
on dozens of companies.

402
00:28:33.960 --> 00:28:35.109
Shit, son.

403
00:28:35.640 --> 00:28:36.868
I suppose

404
00:28:37.040 --> 00:28:39.713
you're spreading false information
about more than one company.

405
00:28:39.880 --> 00:28:43.759
If that's what you're doing, you're just
gonna have to stop shorting them all.

406
00:28:44.120 --> 00:28:45.840
That's ridiculous.
I can't be expected to...

407
00:28:48.680 --> 00:28:50.398
Ooh, I know.

408
00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:55.037
All right, get your chin up, Simon.
No pouting on my watch.

409
00:28:55.640 --> 00:28:57.153
Yeah, you're a man. You just...

410
00:28:57.320 --> 00:28:58.753
You're a man in your own way.

411
00:29:02.640 --> 00:29:03.640
All right.

412
00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:09.639
I'm an avid reader of the Journal.

413
00:29:09.800 --> 00:29:13.156
So, I expect the cooperation
to be reflected there.

414
00:29:14.920 --> 00:29:16.148
Simon?

415
00:29:16.520 --> 00:29:17.748
Are we good?

416
00:29:18.240 --> 00:29:19.240
Yeah?

417
00:29:22.080 --> 00:29:24.230
Attaboy, Simon. Proud of you.

418
00:30:12.960 --> 00:30:13.960
Oh, hello.

419
00:30:14.160 --> 00:30:17.436
Good morning. Oh, shit... Hi.

420
00:30:18.080 --> 00:30:19.115
- Hi.
- Um, um...

421
00:30:19.920 --> 00:30:22.639
I'm Dana Cummings.
You're the consultant? Mr. Wolff?

422
00:30:22.840 --> 00:30:25.638
- Chris.
- Hi, Chris, then.

423
00:30:25.840 --> 00:30:26.955
I'm Dana.

424
00:30:27.120 --> 00:30:28.394
Cummings.

425
00:30:29.320 --> 00:30:30.799
Yes. Um...

426
00:30:31.400 --> 00:30:33.470
These are all the files you wanted.

427
00:30:33.680 --> 00:30:37.514
I cross-referenced them
by year, and alphabetically, so...

428
00:30:38.160 --> 00:30:39.593
It must have taken you all night.

429
00:30:39.760 --> 00:30:41.239
It sure did.

430
00:30:42.480 --> 00:30:43.480
Hmm.

431
00:30:43.760 --> 00:30:44.760
Right.

432
00:30:45.360 --> 00:30:46.509
So...

433
00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:52.149
So...

434
00:30:55.920 --> 00:30:57.831
What do you want, Dana Cummings?

435
00:30:58.720 --> 00:31:01.359
Oh, Mr. Blackburn, um...

436
00:31:02.360 --> 00:31:03.952
Sorry, he said I should...

437
00:31:04.320 --> 00:31:07.278
I'm the person
who first noticed the missing...

438
00:31:07.440 --> 00:31:10.432
- What I think was the missing money.
- Yes, I understand. I'll find it.

439
00:31:11.280 --> 00:31:14.955
Yeah. I thought we could... Have lunch...

440
00:31:15.280 --> 00:31:16.633
I brought my own lunch.

441
00:31:16.800 --> 00:31:17.949
No...

442
00:31:18.360 --> 00:31:19.634
I bring my own lunch, too.

443
00:31:19.800 --> 00:31:21.950
I can answer
any questions that you have...

444
00:31:22.120 --> 00:31:24.190
I have no questions.

445
00:31:25.120 --> 00:31:29.432
Yeah, okay. Yeah, you wanna
make your own assessment.

446
00:31:29.600 --> 00:31:30.794
Yes, thank you.

447
00:31:32.200 --> 00:31:34.111
Okay. Um...

448
00:31:34.960 --> 00:31:37.474
I'm in accounting if you need anything.

449
00:31:37.640 --> 00:31:39.153
There's, uh,

450
00:31:39.320 --> 00:31:41.151
some donuts there for you.

451
00:31:41.320 --> 00:31:43.151
I don't eat donuts.

452
00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:45.000
Okay.

453
00:31:52.160 --> 00:31:53.160
Mr. Secretary!

454
00:31:53.320 --> 00:31:54.456
Yes, Helen.

455
00:31:54.480 --> 00:31:55.879
Sir, there's been speculation

456
00:31:56.040 --> 00:31:59.112
that your ability
to link banks in South Florida

457
00:31:59.280 --> 00:32:01.157
to money laundering efforts of terrorists

458
00:32:01.320 --> 00:32:04.392
are actually the result of
a whistleblower or the NSA.

459
00:32:04.560 --> 00:32:05.560
Care to comment?

460
00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:07.976
Let me turn this over
to the head of my task force,

461
00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:10.639
Financial Crimes Director, Raymond King.

462
00:32:15.840 --> 00:32:18.877
Folks, there's no great mystery here.

463
00:32:19.080 --> 00:32:21.674
Nothing fancy. Just team effort,

464
00:32:21.840 --> 00:32:25.879
comprised of long hours of
good old-fashioned investigative work.

465
00:32:26.520 --> 00:32:27.520
Questions?

466
00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:31.776
Could you answer
the whistleblower question?

467
00:32:31.800 --> 00:32:33.080
No.

468
00:32:35.360 --> 00:32:36.713
Hey, Sorkis, give me something.

469
00:32:36.880 --> 00:32:40.873
I matched the face in your Antwerp photo
to surveillance video in NYPD database.

470
00:32:41.040 --> 00:32:43.873
Wait, wait, wait. NYPD?
What did you find?

471
00:32:45.200 --> 00:32:48.476
2006. Your guy takes out two mob enforcers

472
00:32:48.640 --> 00:32:52.076
with a steak knife he lifted off
an Italian restaurant down the street.

473
00:32:52.880 --> 00:32:54.760
Then he strolls into
a den of stone-cold killers

474
00:32:54.920 --> 00:32:56.797
and goes on a seven-man killing spree,

475
00:32:56.960 --> 00:32:58.393
using their own weapons.

476
00:33:01.080 --> 00:33:02.798
Headshot, headshot, headshot.

477
00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:04.069
Sorkis, stop.

478
00:33:04.240 --> 00:33:06.549
A den of stone-cold killers?
Where is this?

479
00:33:06.720 --> 00:33:09.553
The Ravenite. Headquarters
of the Gambino crime family.

480
00:33:09.720 --> 00:33:12.075
He killed Anthony "Little Tony" Bazzano.

481
00:33:12.560 --> 00:33:15.279
Forensics lists cause of death
as blunt force trauma.

482
00:33:15.560 --> 00:33:18.233
Your boy kicked him in the head once.

483
00:33:18.400 --> 00:33:20.231
Again. Play it again.

484
00:33:21.400 --> 00:33:23.152
Hey, hey, hey!

485
00:33:23.400 --> 00:33:25.630
What the fuck?

486
00:33:26.560 --> 00:33:28.676
Wait! I gotta call it in!

487
00:33:30.520 --> 00:33:32.351
I've also got an audio file here.

488
00:33:32.520 --> 00:33:34.431
Inside of the Ravenite was bugged.

489
00:33:35.840 --> 00:33:36.840
Come on.

490
00:33:38.680 --> 00:33:39.680
Please.

491
00:33:39.840 --> 00:33:41.319
That's Little Tony.

492
00:33:41.640 --> 00:33:42.914
I'm fucking begging you.

493
00:33:43.120 --> 00:33:45.634
I didn't touch him.
I didn't touch that old man!

494
00:33:45.800 --> 00:33:47.136
Okay,
get me that recording ASAP.

495
00:33:47.160 --> 00:33:48.536
I wasn't even...

496
00:33:50.640 --> 00:33:51.640
M.B.,

497
00:33:52.120 --> 00:33:54.111
you're an analyst for Treasury.

498
00:33:55.520 --> 00:33:57.829
What the hell have you got yourself into?

499
00:34:25.160 --> 00:34:27.799
What do you have to hit
to dent a steel thermos?

500
00:34:30.080 --> 00:34:31.479
It's just old.

501
00:34:36.840 --> 00:34:40.071
How did you, um,
get into financial consulting?

502
00:34:40.240 --> 00:34:43.118
Department of Labor
statistics indicate

503
00:34:43.280 --> 00:34:45.396
it's one of
the fastest-growing professions.

504
00:34:45.920 --> 00:34:48.912
Actuarial sciences are experiencing
tremendous growth as well.

505
00:34:51.400 --> 00:34:52.515
Okay.

506
00:34:55.360 --> 00:34:56.759
I like the balance of it.

507
00:34:58.920 --> 00:35:02.674
You know, I like finding things
that aren't obvious.

508
00:35:04.440 --> 00:35:06.510
Plus, my dad was an accountant.

509
00:35:07.520 --> 00:35:08.520
He actually...

510
00:35:10.680 --> 00:35:13.717
You know, he had the whole shtick.
The, uh...

511
00:35:15.120 --> 00:35:18.510
You know, the little amortization book,
and the green eyeshade,

512
00:35:18.720 --> 00:35:20.756
and the, like,
dorky pocket protector and...

513
00:35:20.920 --> 00:35:22.558
I have a pocket protector.

514
00:35:25.440 --> 00:35:28.637
That's a nice one.
I mean, his was dorky, that's...

515
00:35:28.800 --> 00:35:30.233
Yours is nice.

516
00:35:32.520 --> 00:35:34.431
Um, but he convinced me
to go into the field.

517
00:35:34.600 --> 00:35:37.040
Because I wanted to study art
at the Art Institute of Chicago,

518
00:35:37.760 --> 00:35:39.751
but art doesn't pay the mortgage.

519
00:35:39.920 --> 00:35:42.036
"Art doesn't pay the mortgage,
young lady."

520
00:35:43.880 --> 00:35:46.394
Dad's tastes ran more to
Dogs Playing Poker.

521
00:35:46.560 --> 00:35:48.039
I like Dogs Playing Poker.

522
00:35:49.080 --> 00:35:51.230
Because dogs would never bet on things,

523
00:35:51.400 --> 00:35:53.470
and so, it's incongruous.

524
00:35:54.840 --> 00:35:56.910
I like incongruity.

525
00:36:01.080 --> 00:36:04.755
Yeah, Dogs Playing Poker is nice.
It's just sort of a...

526
00:36:05.960 --> 00:36:07.598
Just different.

527
00:36:08.320 --> 00:36:10.550
So, I studied accounting
at the University of Chicago,

528
00:36:10.720 --> 00:36:11.755
where fun goes to die.

529
00:36:11.920 --> 00:36:12.920
Why?

530
00:36:14.680 --> 00:36:15.908
Why what?

531
00:36:16.240 --> 00:36:19.152
Why does fun go to die
at the University of Chicago?

532
00:36:19.920 --> 00:36:21.831
Oh, no, it's just an expression.

533
00:36:24.640 --> 00:36:25.789
I'm joking.

534
00:36:30.840 --> 00:36:31.840
Right.

535
00:36:41.840 --> 00:36:44.229
- Um, I'll leave you to it.
- Okay.

536
00:36:44.400 --> 00:36:46.789
Let me know if you need anything
while you're here.

537
00:36:49.280 --> 00:36:50.280
Have a nice day.

538
00:36:50.440 --> 00:36:51.919
Yes. You, too.

539
00:37:14.840 --> 00:37:19.960
Explain the 376,109...
6,500,000... 6, 008,000...

540
00:37:41.640 --> 00:37:43.376
Accounts receivable,
earnings before interest...

541
00:37:43.400 --> 00:37:45.197
Tax, depreciation,
administrative expenses...

542
00:37:55.120 --> 00:37:56.348
100,644,000...

543
00:38:01.600 --> 00:38:04.797
Hydraulic sync systems,
aluminum bar supplies,

544
00:38:04.960 --> 00:38:06.791
techmod fitting, stable joints...

545
00:38:46.040 --> 00:38:47.240
Please.

546
00:38:47.840 --> 00:38:49.239
I'm fucking begging you.

547
00:38:49.400 --> 00:38:52.198
I didn't touch him.
I didn't touch that old man!

548
00:38:52.360 --> 00:38:53.760
I wasn't even...

549
00:39:01.800 --> 00:39:03.279
Okay.

550
00:39:05.080 --> 00:39:06.399
Give me something.

551
00:39:11.520 --> 00:39:12.520
Please.

552
00:39:13.520 --> 00:39:14.635
...fucking begging you.

553
00:39:14.800 --> 00:39:17.109
I didn't touch him.
I didn't touch that old man!

554
00:39:17.880 --> 00:39:19.176
I wasn't even...

555
00:39:28.280 --> 00:39:30.191
Come on, come on, come on.

556
00:39:35.240 --> 00:39:36.240
...begging you.

557
00:39:36.480 --> 00:39:39.472
I didn't touch him.
I didn't touch that old man!

558
00:40:09.040 --> 00:40:10.439
Born on a Monday

559
00:40:10.800 --> 00:40:13.712
Christened on Tuesday
Married on Wednesday

560
00:40:13.880 --> 00:40:14.995
Solomon Grundy

561
00:40:15.680 --> 00:40:17.033
Born on Monday

562
00:40:17.360 --> 00:40:20.352
Christened on Tuesday
Married on Wednesday

563
00:40:20.560 --> 00:40:21.834
Solomon Grundy

564
00:40:35.320 --> 00:40:38.120
Come in! Come in, come in, come in.
You have to see this. Look at this.

565
00:40:38.200 --> 00:40:40.111
It's gonna blow you away.

566
00:40:40.280 --> 00:40:43.511
I mean, it'll just jump right out at you.

567
00:40:45.600 --> 00:40:46.635
There it is.

568
00:40:46.960 --> 00:40:47.960
Uh-huh.

569
00:40:48.320 --> 00:40:49.639
Living Robotics, 10 years ago.

570
00:40:49.840 --> 00:40:51.096
Earnings before interest,
tax, depreciation.

571
00:40:51.120 --> 00:40:53.918
$14,495,719.

572
00:40:54.080 --> 00:40:55.149
Nine years ago,

573
00:40:55.720 --> 00:40:58.359
earnings before tax and depreciation...

574
00:40:59.080 --> 00:41:01.230
Revenues go up, profits go down.

575
00:41:01.440 --> 00:41:04.637
Down? No large capital expenditures
dragging profits down.

576
00:41:04.800 --> 00:41:07.109
No spike in raw materials or labor costs.

577
00:41:07.280 --> 00:41:09.555
Year eight,
profits and revenue both go up,

578
00:41:09.720 --> 00:41:11.199
but not in a commensurate fashion.

579
00:41:11.400 --> 00:41:12.549
X no longer equals Y.

580
00:41:12.720 --> 00:41:15.598
Six, five, four, three.
You're making money.

581
00:41:15.760 --> 00:41:16.760
But there's a leak.

582
00:41:17.280 --> 00:41:18.793
And the leak is...

583
00:41:19.360 --> 00:41:21.191
Leak, where's the leak? Here.

584
00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:26.880
Slewitt Manufacturing.
I've signed these checks.

585
00:41:26.960 --> 00:41:28.393
- Who authorized it?
- Ed.

586
00:41:28.560 --> 00:41:31.360
Mr. Chilton. They make electronic
assemblies for the consumer division.

587
00:41:31.640 --> 00:41:33.949
No, they don't. Look at this.

588
00:41:34.960 --> 00:41:36.712
You notice anything?

589
00:41:38.480 --> 00:41:40.120
- Second number in each is a three.
- Yes.

590
00:41:41.280 --> 00:41:43.191
Most people,
when generating random numbers

591
00:41:43.360 --> 00:41:44.793
tend to rely subconsciously

592
00:41:44.960 --> 00:41:46.216
- on certain patterns.
- Patterns, yeah.

593
00:41:46.240 --> 00:41:47.240
Yes.

594
00:41:47.440 --> 00:41:48.680
- I was right!
- You were right.

595
00:41:50.160 --> 00:41:51.160
Yeah.

596
00:41:52.280 --> 00:41:56.273
I went through these ledgers for months,
and I got through one fiscal year.

597
00:41:56.440 --> 00:41:58.032
You went through 15 overnight?

598
00:41:58.240 --> 00:41:59.680
That's not even the best part, look.

599
00:41:59.720 --> 00:42:03.076
The best part is, they're routing money
to a company that doesn't exist.

600
00:42:03.240 --> 00:42:06.232
And yet, profits go up.
And they continue going up.

601
00:42:06.400 --> 00:42:07.594
Absolutely makes no sense.

602
00:42:07.760 --> 00:42:09.796
- Where's the money coming from?
- Exactly!

603
00:42:10.320 --> 00:42:11.594
Um, it's not inventory?

604
00:42:11.760 --> 00:42:12.909
Inventory turns. No.

605
00:42:13.080 --> 00:42:15.230
- Chargebacks to vendors?
- No. Perfectly in order.

606
00:42:15.400 --> 00:42:17.755
- Internal offsets?
- No. That's a terrible idea.

607
00:42:18.040 --> 00:42:19.553
Um...

608
00:42:26.400 --> 00:42:29.233
Cummings, you're needed in

609
00:42:29.440 --> 00:42:31.590
whatever area I'm paying you
to be needed in.

610
00:42:31.760 --> 00:42:32.760
Sorry.

611
00:42:46.600 --> 00:42:47.635
And?

612
00:42:56.640 --> 00:43:00.428
$61,679,000.

613
00:43:01.320 --> 00:43:02.639
And some change.

614
00:43:03.640 --> 00:43:05.756
Who did it? Best guess.

615
00:43:05.920 --> 00:43:07.512
I don't guess.

616
00:43:09.360 --> 00:43:11.669
You'll have a report for me?

617
00:43:11.960 --> 00:43:13.837
When I'm finished, yes.

618
00:43:47.440 --> 00:43:49.317
- Hey, Ed.
- What the...

619
00:43:50.040 --> 00:43:51.871
We're having lemon merengue pie.

620
00:43:52.040 --> 00:43:54.076
Those two bottles of insulin.

621
00:43:56.680 --> 00:43:59.353
You know, I just thought

622
00:43:59.680 --> 00:44:03.036
that you would appreciate me
treating you like an adult, right?

623
00:44:03.240 --> 00:44:04.912
So, here's what I got.

624
00:44:10.240 --> 00:44:15.189
You administer your own accidental
insulin overdose, and just...

625
00:44:16.320 --> 00:44:17.389
Die.

626
00:44:17.560 --> 00:44:18.993
But do it with dignity.

627
00:44:19.240 --> 00:44:23.916
Your wife, who's sleeping upstairs,
she'll be the beneficiary

628
00:44:24.080 --> 00:44:28.039
of what's gotta be a very generous
insurance policy, am I right?

629
00:44:28.200 --> 00:44:30.475
But the only way she's gonna
collect on that policy, Ed,

630
00:44:30.640 --> 00:44:33.234
is if we have the appearance
of an accident.

631
00:44:33.440 --> 00:44:37.194
If we lay our hands on you,
you're gonna fight, squeal.

632
00:44:37.400 --> 00:44:39.038
She wakes up, my hands are tied.

633
00:44:39.200 --> 00:44:41.430
One accidental death is just that,
but two, no.

634
00:44:41.600 --> 00:44:43.591
I'll have no choice.

635
00:44:43.760 --> 00:44:46.513
I'll have to rock and roll
a home invasion,

636
00:44:46.680 --> 00:44:48.432
violate your wife a dozen different ways,

637
00:44:48.600 --> 00:44:50.830
kill you both,
burn the place to the ground.

638
00:44:52.880 --> 00:44:55.314
I'm sorry for that. Ed, Ed, Ed?

639
00:44:55.480 --> 00:44:58.950
Hey, nobody's gonna
violate your wife, okay?

640
00:44:59.440 --> 00:45:02.910
Aside from what that would say
about me as a human being,

641
00:45:03.520 --> 00:45:05.556
physiologically it's a non-starter.

642
00:45:05.760 --> 00:45:09.878
Sometimes I think I just say shit,
sample what comes out of my mouth.

643
00:45:11.320 --> 00:45:13.834
I will, however,
park a.45 in her brainpan.

644
00:45:15.680 --> 00:45:17.238
I honor my commitments.

645
00:45:17.840 --> 00:45:22.436
It's a concept you and your sticky fingers
probably find hard to grasp.

646
00:45:27.480 --> 00:45:29.311
Make a decision, sir.

647
00:45:40.880 --> 00:45:43.155
Where are you going? Sir?

648
00:45:43.920 --> 00:45:44.989
Sir?

649
00:45:47.120 --> 00:45:49.076
Stop that. Why are you doing that?
Stop that.

650
00:45:49.240 --> 00:45:52.073
Sir? Sir? What are you doing? Excuse me?

651
00:45:52.240 --> 00:45:53.878
Mr. Chilton passed away.

652
00:45:54.400 --> 00:45:56.436
I was told to clean up the room.

653
00:45:57.480 --> 00:45:58.629
What's happening?

654
00:46:00.920 --> 00:46:02.797
Can you give us a minute, please?

655
00:46:05.920 --> 00:46:07.512
This is the balance of your contract.

656
00:46:07.720 --> 00:46:09.600
- I understand you're upset...
- Yes, I'm upset.

657
00:46:09.680 --> 00:46:10.680
I haven't finished yet.

658
00:46:10.840 --> 00:46:12.114
Yes, you have.

659
00:46:12.760 --> 00:46:14.478
Ed was a diabetic for 30 years.

660
00:46:14.640 --> 00:46:16.760
You think he didn't know
how to check his blood sugar?

661
00:46:17.080 --> 00:46:19.992
Whatever unresolved issues remain,

662
00:46:20.160 --> 00:46:23.436
my friend was poisoned enough by them
to take his own life.

663
00:46:24.440 --> 00:46:26.520
As far as I'm concerned,
whatever he did is forgiven.

664
00:46:27.120 --> 00:46:29.076
Please. I need to finish, please.

665
00:46:29.240 --> 00:46:31.515
- Sorry, I'll come back.
- No, no, come in, dear.

666
00:46:32.680 --> 00:46:34.033
We're done.

667
00:46:35.880 --> 00:46:37.074
You're very good, Mr. Wolff.

668
00:46:38.160 --> 00:46:40.799
But I hope our paths never cross again.

669
00:46:41.480 --> 00:46:44.313
I'm responsible
for the death of my best friend.

670
00:46:45.200 --> 00:46:47.760
I'd prefer not to be reminded of it.

671
00:46:59.320 --> 00:47:01.276
Do you think that's true?

672
00:47:02.160 --> 00:47:04.116
That Mr. Chilton killed himself...

673
00:47:04.840 --> 00:47:06.876
I mean, do you think we're responsible?

674
00:47:07.440 --> 00:47:10.273
It's very hard for me to interpret
why people do what they do.

675
00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:17.389
I'm not finished.
I'm not finished with this.

676
00:47:18.840 --> 00:47:20.990
I mean, look... Look at this.

677
00:47:22.520 --> 00:47:24.795
See, cost reports. This is out of order.

678
00:47:24.960 --> 00:47:27.952
They completely rearranged this.
I don't...

679
00:47:28.480 --> 00:47:30.516
I'm not finished. I'm not finished...

680
00:47:35.800 --> 00:47:37.028
Bye, Chris.

681
00:49:03.240 --> 00:49:04.798
No! Mom! Mom!

682
00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:07.833
Mom! Mom! Mom!

683
00:49:09.640 --> 00:49:11.551
Why is Mom leaving?

684
00:49:11.960 --> 00:49:13.188
Mom!

685
00:49:54.600 --> 00:49:55.680
Again.

686
00:50:17.720 --> 00:50:18.755
Again.

687
00:50:41.080 --> 00:50:42.149
Enough.

688
00:50:47.520 --> 00:50:48.589
They're not done.

689
00:50:49.040 --> 00:50:52.396
Tomorrow is another day.
They have done their best.

690
00:50:53.200 --> 00:50:56.829
If that were true, you'd be covered
in blood and snot, not them.

691
00:50:57.960 --> 00:50:59.313
Keep going.

692
00:51:11.800 --> 00:51:15.793
Aggression, correctly channeled,
overcomes a lot of flaws.

693
00:51:17.800 --> 00:51:20.109
Tapping into that aggression requires

694
00:51:20.960 --> 00:51:23.872
peeling back several layers of yourself.

695
00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:27.798
It's my job to know my sons' limitations.

696
00:51:29.640 --> 00:51:30.834
Get up.

697
00:51:32.800 --> 00:51:34.119
It's your job to peel.

698
00:51:34.560 --> 00:51:36.596
Do your job. On your feet.

699
00:51:54.480 --> 00:51:55.629
Again!

700
00:52:03.360 --> 00:52:06.716
We could have went to his house,
shot him in his home.

701
00:52:06.880 --> 00:52:08.552
And we'd be on a plane by now.

702
00:52:08.720 --> 00:52:11.951
Or on a security camera,
or some nosy neighbor's iPhone.

703
00:52:16.080 --> 00:52:17.354
Call the bookkeeper in.

704
00:52:19.040 --> 00:52:20.496
He's just too far.
He won't hear...

705
00:52:20.520 --> 00:52:21.635
Now.

706
00:52:21.800 --> 00:52:24.519
Let's go. Get up. Come on.

707
00:52:27.200 --> 00:52:28.315
Move!

708
00:52:30.640 --> 00:52:31.993
Come on, come on, come on.

709
00:52:37.960 --> 00:52:39.359
Christian!

710
00:52:43.120 --> 00:52:44.120
Chris!

711
00:52:48.280 --> 00:52:50.350
Again! Louder!

712
00:52:54.080 --> 00:52:55.080
Up! Up!

713
00:53:00.640 --> 00:53:02.278
- No, no! Please!
- What the fuck?

714
00:53:02.440 --> 00:53:03.440
Dolores!

715
00:53:06.160 --> 00:53:07.195
She's coming with me.

716
00:53:07.360 --> 00:53:08.713
No, no, stop! Stop! Leave her...

717
00:53:15.080 --> 00:53:17.514
We're all going together.
Pull that truck around back.

718
00:53:17.680 --> 00:53:19.398
Let's go! Let's go!

719
00:53:23.240 --> 00:53:24.240
Let's move!

720
00:53:25.760 --> 00:53:27.955
Come on! Drive! Drive now!

721
00:53:38.440 --> 00:53:39.800
Jesus fucking Christ!

722
00:53:44.920 --> 00:53:46.069
God damn it!

723
00:53:49.640 --> 00:53:50.834
Son of a bitch!

724
00:54:30.120 --> 00:54:31.348
What the fuck?

725
00:54:44.760 --> 00:54:47.513
When I say the name of your employer,
you say "yes."

726
00:54:47.720 --> 00:54:48.720
Practice.

727
00:54:49.840 --> 00:54:50.875
Yes.

728
00:54:51.880 --> 00:54:52.880
Camorra.

729
00:54:53.560 --> 00:54:54.560
Juárez.

730
00:54:55.000 --> 00:54:56.194
Gambino.

731
00:54:57.080 --> 00:54:58.274
Do you understand the rules?

732
00:54:58.480 --> 00:55:00.835
My left pocket.

733
00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:03.911
They paid to

734
00:55:04.640 --> 00:55:05.834
kill you both.

735
00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:07.149
That's all I know.

736
00:55:29.760 --> 00:55:31.680
- Hello, dreamboat.
- Dana's in danger.

737
00:55:31.840 --> 00:55:34.400
Kill Christian Wolff,
transfer all domestic accounts overseas.

738
00:55:34.600 --> 00:55:36.591
- Current vehicle?
- F-150.

739
00:55:37.320 --> 00:55:39.470
- Virus to triple Z?
- Wipe everything.

740
00:55:41.880 --> 00:55:43.598
Done. In the DOT database now.

741
00:55:43.880 --> 00:55:45.677
Reassigning the license and VIN.

742
00:55:45.840 --> 00:55:48.354
I have George Boole
or Charles Babbage in the queue.

743
00:55:48.520 --> 00:55:50.272
Boole. Obviously.

744
00:55:50.440 --> 00:55:52.032
Silly of me. What else?

745
00:55:53.960 --> 00:55:55.313
She is not your problem.

746
00:55:55.480 --> 00:55:57.914
Straight to the trailer,
hook it up, and disappear.

747
00:55:58.120 --> 00:55:59.348
There's no time.

748
00:55:59.520 --> 00:56:00.839
Only the trailer.

749
00:56:02.120 --> 00:56:04.554
Address and phone number. Get it.

750
00:56:35.840 --> 00:56:37.114
She's not answering.

751
00:58:08.880 --> 00:58:10.080
Could have used the small box.

752
00:58:10.320 --> 00:58:12.038
Well, she looked bigger in the photo.

753
00:58:16.040 --> 00:58:17.040
God!

754
00:58:53.480 --> 00:58:55.152
God damn!

755
00:58:55.520 --> 00:58:56.520
Bitch!

756
00:58:59.400 --> 00:59:00.400
Fuck.

757
00:59:33.880 --> 00:59:35.108
We should go.

758
00:59:40.960 --> 00:59:43.838
Since when are accountants
difficult to ventilate?

759
00:59:45.320 --> 00:59:46.673
Dead?

760
00:59:46.840 --> 00:59:49.832
Christ! What'd he do, hit him
over the head with an adding machine?

761
00:59:54.120 --> 00:59:55.348
Oh, God.

762
00:59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.798
All right, just put me in touch
with the client.

763
01:00:01.800 --> 01:00:04.189
I'll handle this accountant myself.

764
01:00:07.320 --> 01:00:09.959
Running isn't an option for me.
I can't just walk out on my life!

765
01:00:10.120 --> 01:00:13.351
We have to go to the police.
That's what normal, taxpaying people do!

766
01:00:13.520 --> 01:00:17.513
Police can't protect you from someone
who can afford to return $61 million.

767
01:00:17.800 --> 01:00:19.496
Return?
What are you talking about, "return"?

768
01:00:19.520 --> 01:00:21.272
The money was being put back.

769
01:00:21.440 --> 01:00:22.589
Stay here.

770
01:01:24.240 --> 01:01:25.320
What are you doing in here?

771
01:01:25.400 --> 01:01:26.549
- Who are you?
- You can't...

772
01:01:26.720 --> 01:01:27.835
You should not be here.

773
01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:29.911
Sit down. Sit right there.

774
01:01:33.760 --> 01:01:35.193
What is this place?

775
01:01:36.560 --> 01:01:38.869
PanAmerica, Airstream.

776
01:01:39.200 --> 01:01:41.794
34 feet 7 inches long,

777
01:01:42.280 --> 01:01:44.191
8 feet 5 inches wide.

778
01:01:44.800 --> 01:01:47.792
Dimensions which are perfectly adequate
for one person.

779
01:01:47.960 --> 01:01:49.393
Preferable, even.

780
01:01:50.440 --> 01:01:51.919
This is where you live?

781
01:01:52.080 --> 01:01:54.913
No, I don't live here.
This is a storage unit.

782
01:01:55.080 --> 01:01:56.080
That would be weird.

783
01:01:56.240 --> 01:01:57.639
That's what would be weird?

784
01:01:57.800 --> 01:02:00.189
I'd like to spend more time here.

785
01:02:00.400 --> 01:02:03.119
However, I'm afraid some of my clients
might follow me.

786
01:02:04.040 --> 01:02:06.395
Why would your clients follow you?
You're an accountant!

787
01:02:07.320 --> 01:02:10.153
How do you know what to do here?
Why are you prepared for this?

788
01:02:10.320 --> 01:02:11.799
Plus, this is on wheels,

789
01:02:11.960 --> 01:02:14.190
which means I can hook it up
and be gone in 12 minutes.

790
01:02:14.360 --> 01:02:15.360
Usually.

791
01:02:15.680 --> 01:02:18.558
Sarcasm? Is that sarcasm?

792
01:02:18.720 --> 01:02:21.393
No, that's not sarcasm.
I don't use sarcasm. It's irritation.

793
01:02:21.560 --> 01:02:24.136
Everything in the world that is
important to me is in this trailer.

794
01:02:24.160 --> 01:02:26.680
And right now, changing my routine
for you is jeopardizing that.

795
01:02:31.600 --> 01:02:33.670
Tell me that's not an original Pollock.

796
01:02:38.760 --> 01:02:39.909
We should go.

797
01:02:42.160 --> 01:02:43.275
Now.

798
01:02:59.360 --> 01:03:01.112
- Medina.
- Miss Medina?

799
01:03:01.280 --> 01:03:04.033
This is Gordon Amundson
with the FBI Language Services.

800
01:03:04.200 --> 01:03:05.997
Uh, yeah. Any luck?

801
01:03:06.160 --> 01:03:08.276
It's an unusual audio file.

802
01:03:08.440 --> 01:03:12.035
Solomon Grundy is a nursery rhyme
circa mid-1800s.

803
01:03:12.200 --> 01:03:14.555
Your voice has four of
the six intonation patterns

804
01:03:14.720 --> 01:03:16.551
we use to define American English.

805
01:03:16.720 --> 01:03:18.995
That's difficult to confirm with a rhyme.

806
01:03:19.720 --> 01:03:22.871
Out of curiosity,
was your subject a trauma victim?

807
01:03:23.160 --> 01:03:24.957
Um, why do you ask that?

808
01:03:25.120 --> 01:03:27.475
Well, you indicated on your submission

809
01:03:27.640 --> 01:03:30.359
that this event occurred
in a high-stress environment?

810
01:03:30.520 --> 01:03:32.397
Yeah. Exceptionally.

811
01:03:32.560 --> 01:03:33.959
That's interesting.

812
01:03:34.160 --> 01:03:37.630
The verse was repeated
a total of four and a half times

813
01:03:37.800 --> 01:03:44.035
with zero variation in pitch, span, tempo,
volume, or articulatory precision.

814
01:03:44.200 --> 01:03:45.918
So, what does that mean, exactly?

815
01:03:46.080 --> 01:03:48.548
Well, we often see
this type of repetitive chanting

816
01:03:48.760 --> 01:03:50.910
in children
who have been exposed to trauma

817
01:03:51.080 --> 01:03:52.991
or persons with
neurodevelopmental disorders.

818
01:03:53.520 --> 01:03:55.351
Neurodevelopmental disorders?

819
01:03:55.560 --> 01:03:57.755
Fragile-X syndrome, autism.

820
01:03:58.520 --> 01:03:59.839
Okay, so...

821
01:04:00.080 --> 01:04:01.752
Let's say I was looking at mugshots.

822
01:04:01.920 --> 01:04:05.435
How would that present itself?
What exactly would I be looking for?

823
01:04:05.600 --> 01:04:10.196
Fragile-X: Elongated face,
protruding ears, poor muscle tone.

824
01:04:10.680 --> 01:04:13.399
Autism's nearly impossible
to identify visually.

825
01:04:13.560 --> 01:04:15.118
The traits are behavioral:

826
01:04:15.280 --> 01:04:18.078
difficulty with
social interaction, communication,

827
01:04:18.280 --> 01:04:20.077
lack of eye contact.

828
01:04:20.600 --> 01:04:23.114
Lack of eye contact.

829
01:04:23.600 --> 01:04:25.113
Okay.

830
01:04:25.280 --> 01:04:26.280
Good luck to you.

831
01:04:26.440 --> 01:04:27.440
Thanks.

832
01:05:18.440 --> 01:05:19.998
None of this makes sense.

833
01:05:20.160 --> 01:05:23.311
Why go through the trouble of skimming
the money if you're gonna put it back?

834
01:05:23.520 --> 01:05:24.760
Over the last two years,

835
01:05:24.840 --> 01:05:28.913
the number of invoices submitted
by Slewitt Manufacturing declined.

836
01:05:29.320 --> 01:05:30.639
Scared of getting caught?

837
01:05:32.520 --> 01:05:33.635
Price hikes?

838
01:05:33.800 --> 01:05:35.950
Prices of consumer electronics
go down, not up.

839
01:05:36.160 --> 01:05:38.310
Right, down, yeah.

840
01:05:40.200 --> 01:05:41.474
I can't afford this.

841
01:05:41.640 --> 01:05:43.278
I know. My treat.

842
01:05:46.120 --> 01:05:48.953
In the US, 104 men,

843
01:05:49.120 --> 01:05:53.352
last name any standard derivation
of your mathematician, Carl Gauss,

844
01:05:53.520 --> 01:05:58.958
reported over $500,000
in any of the last seven years.

845
01:05:59.120 --> 01:06:00.792
Okay. Go a million plus.

846
01:06:02.320 --> 01:06:03.514
Seventeen.

847
01:06:03.680 --> 01:06:07.195
Of the 17,
how many between the ages of 25 and 45?

848
01:06:07.960 --> 01:06:09.029
Four.

849
01:06:09.480 --> 01:06:10.515
Of those four,

850
01:06:10.680 --> 01:06:14.468
only one has an income stream
that's cash-heavy or easily laundered.

851
01:06:14.640 --> 01:06:15.789
And he

852
01:06:17.160 --> 01:06:18.878
died three years ago.

853
01:06:25.800 --> 01:06:26.800
What's this?

854
01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:29.468
It's names of
the 100 most famous mathematicians.

855
01:06:31.400 --> 01:06:32.800
Look, we know what we're doing now.

856
01:06:32.840 --> 01:06:36.230
So, just enter the names,
narrow down the search right off the bat.

857
01:06:36.400 --> 01:06:37.833
Male, Caucasian,

858
01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:40.594
25 to 45, earning a million plus.

859
01:06:40.760 --> 01:06:43.877
No investment income.
He'll concentrate on cash.

860
01:06:45.080 --> 01:06:46.354
What's in it for me?

861
01:06:47.920 --> 01:06:49.876
Look, if you help me find him,

862
01:06:50.040 --> 01:06:52.080
I'll see what I can do
about getting you outta here.

863
01:06:54.200 --> 01:06:55.428
Please.

864
01:06:56.720 --> 01:06:58.517
Single earner or filing jointly?

865
01:07:18.960 --> 01:07:20.757
Hey, those paintings in your trailer...

866
01:07:21.120 --> 01:07:23.270
- They're real, right?
- Yes.

867
01:07:23.920 --> 01:07:25.876
You didn't buy them at auction, did you?

868
01:07:26.040 --> 01:07:27.758
They're a form of payment.

869
01:07:28.640 --> 01:07:29.789
Right.

870
01:07:31.040 --> 01:07:32.109
Hey.

871
01:07:32.640 --> 01:07:33.959
Thank you.

872
01:07:37.400 --> 01:07:38.594
At my apartment.

873
01:07:38.760 --> 01:07:39.760
Oh.

874
01:07:40.800 --> 01:07:41.869
Yeah.

875
01:07:44.760 --> 01:07:46.432
Can we sit down for a second?

876
01:07:48.080 --> 01:07:50.275
Yeah. Okay.

877
01:07:58.640 --> 01:07:59.640
Just...

878
01:08:03.160 --> 01:08:04.275
Sit.

879
01:08:19.480 --> 01:08:21.675
How do you, um,

880
01:08:22.680 --> 01:08:25.956
know how to...

881
01:08:27.200 --> 01:08:30.954
My father was an officer in the Army.
Psychological Operations.

882
01:08:31.520 --> 01:08:35.195
He was concerned that I might be
taken advantage of somehow,

883
01:08:35.360 --> 01:08:39.797
so he arranged for me to train
with a number of specialists

884
01:08:39.960 --> 01:08:41.313
throughout my childhood.

885
01:08:41.720 --> 01:08:44.393
We lived in 34 homes in 17 years.

886
01:08:45.400 --> 01:08:47.277
- You moved 34 times?
- Mmm-hmm.

887
01:08:48.880 --> 01:08:50.552
God. That's extraordinary.

888
01:08:53.320 --> 01:08:55.550
No, I'm sure
it must've been difficult, but...

889
01:08:56.400 --> 01:08:57.913
I haven't been anywhere.

890
01:08:59.880 --> 01:09:03.031
Well, Cancun. Not my proudest moment.

891
01:09:03.880 --> 01:09:04.880
Um...

892
01:09:06.720 --> 01:09:08.073
I just mean...

893
01:09:10.400 --> 01:09:12.868
Your life is unique.

894
01:09:13.080 --> 01:09:17.073
It's not unique. I have
a high-functioning form of autism,

895
01:09:18.280 --> 01:09:20.000
which means I have
an extremely narrow focus

896
01:09:20.120 --> 01:09:23.078
and a hard time abandoning tasks
once I've taken them up.

897
01:09:23.240 --> 01:09:27.392
I have difficulty socializing
with other people, even though

898
01:09:28.840 --> 01:09:30.159
I want to.

899
01:09:36.600 --> 01:09:41.071
When I was a senior in high school,
I wanted this special dress for prom.

900
01:09:41.280 --> 01:09:42.952
I told myself that spending $100

901
01:09:43.120 --> 01:09:44.896
on a trashy dress
that I was gonna wear one time

902
01:09:44.920 --> 01:09:47.136
to an event that I thought was
silly in the first place, was...

903
01:09:47.160 --> 01:09:49.355
- Wasteful.
- Yes.

904
01:09:49.560 --> 01:09:53.997
But Vera Wang
made this black, strapless classic.

905
01:09:54.160 --> 01:09:56.936
It was more expensive, but you could
wear it to all kinds of future events.

906
01:09:56.960 --> 01:09:58.632
- It was an investment.
- Yes.

907
01:09:58.840 --> 01:10:00.717
Where were you when I was in high school?

908
01:10:00.920 --> 01:10:03.115
Oh, North Carolina, Israel.

909
01:10:04.960 --> 01:10:06.109
Right. Um...

910
01:10:07.080 --> 01:10:09.196
The problem was
they wanted $1700 for this dress,

911
01:10:09.360 --> 01:10:10.520
and I didn't have that, so...

912
01:10:10.640 --> 01:10:12.153
- You asked your parents?
- No.

913
01:10:12.800 --> 01:10:14.028
Hang on.

914
01:10:15.840 --> 01:10:18.479
Blackjack. I'd never played a hand,

915
01:10:18.640 --> 01:10:21.296
but I went to the library, and I
checked out all these books on strategy.

916
01:10:21.320 --> 01:10:23.840
And I turned the Naperville North
math club into a little Vegas.

917
01:10:23.960 --> 01:10:25.951
- What's a math club?
- Math club?

918
01:10:27.200 --> 01:10:28.838
You compete against other schools.

919
01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:30.991
Theory and speed math.

920
01:10:31.800 --> 01:10:36.271
Like, what's 298,567 times 92?

921
01:10:36.840 --> 01:10:41.630
27,468, 164.

922
01:10:45.880 --> 01:10:47.154
Right. Um...

923
01:10:48.560 --> 01:10:49.560
Blackjack.

924
01:10:50.320 --> 01:10:53.551
I could tell you
when to hit, stand, split, re-split.

925
01:10:53.720 --> 01:10:56.837
I moved on to card counting,
shuffle tracking, hole carding.

926
01:10:57.000 --> 01:11:00.709
And I took everything I had,
which was $183,

927
01:11:00.880 --> 01:11:03.678
and I drove down to Harrah's in Joliet.

928
01:11:03.840 --> 01:11:05.400
Why was this dress so important to you?

929
01:11:05.520 --> 01:11:07.192
It wasn't about the dress.

930
01:11:09.320 --> 01:11:13.791
I just wanted to walk into the gym
and have everybody say "Wow!"

931
01:11:15.560 --> 01:11:19.030
I was trying to belong.

932
01:11:19.400 --> 01:11:21.311
I was trying to connect.

933
01:11:24.160 --> 01:11:27.240
I think no matter how different we are,
we're all trying to do the same thing.

934
01:11:31.400 --> 01:11:36.030
But I lost all but $20
in the first 10 minutes.

935
01:11:37.200 --> 01:11:39.714
I fed that into a nickel slot
on the way out,

936
01:11:39.880 --> 01:11:41.871
- and I won two grand.
- Hmm.

937
01:11:42.040 --> 01:11:44.395
I used the extra cash to pay for a limo.

938
01:11:46.520 --> 01:11:48.829
Only wore the dress the one time.

939
01:12:01.080 --> 01:12:03.230
Chris, why are we here?

940
01:12:04.240 --> 01:12:05.240
Um...

941
01:12:06.880 --> 01:12:09.189
I thought this hotel
had good water pressure.

942
01:12:09.760 --> 01:12:12.752
The Holiday Inn Express in Aurora
has good water pressure.

943
01:12:12.920 --> 01:12:15.593
Yes, but these towels are very fancy,

944
01:12:16.960 --> 01:12:19.633
and cheaper hotels have scratchy towels.

945
01:12:21.080 --> 01:12:22.479
And

946
01:12:23.600 --> 01:12:25.079
I wanted you to like it.

947
01:12:42.640 --> 01:12:44.756
Crazy Eddie and the Panama Pump.

948
01:12:45.720 --> 01:12:48.473
Crazy Eddie Antar and the Panama Pump.
Have you ever heard of...

949
01:12:48.640 --> 01:12:50.949
- What?
- Crazy Eddie Antar.

950
01:12:51.120 --> 01:12:55.159
He owned a string of electronic stores
in New York City in the '80s.

951
01:12:55.440 --> 01:12:58.830
Crazy Eddie Antar, he started stealing
almost as soon as he opened business.

952
01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:00.115
Okay, I'm not following.

953
01:13:00.280 --> 01:13:01.952
He deposited money in Tel Aviv,

954
01:13:02.120 --> 01:13:05.078
and then he cycled it through Panama
and put it back into his stores.

955
01:13:05.240 --> 01:13:06.760
Okay, why take it out and put it back?

956
01:13:06.840 --> 01:13:09.957
Well, initially he was just stealing
in garden-variety tax evasion,

957
01:13:10.120 --> 01:13:12.315
but then he came up with a better idea.

958
01:13:12.480 --> 01:13:14.391
You see, by taking his own money,

959
01:13:14.560 --> 01:13:16.949
stealing it, and putting it back
on his books...

960
01:13:17.160 --> 01:13:18.593
He was raining cash.

961
01:13:18.760 --> 01:13:20.671
He took the company public at $8 a share.

962
01:13:20.840 --> 01:13:23.513
A year later, it was trading at $75.

963
01:13:25.160 --> 01:13:28.516
- Rita's taking Living Robotics public.
- Yes.

964
01:13:28.680 --> 01:13:30.440
But why would she hire you
in the first place

965
01:13:30.560 --> 01:13:32.630
if she thought you would figure it out?

966
01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:35.194
I don't know.

967
01:13:36.680 --> 01:13:38.193
I'll have to ask her.

968
01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:44.151
Whatever Rita's involvement,
it's not your concern.

969
01:13:45.320 --> 01:13:47.356
You disappear, I make a call.

970
01:13:47.520 --> 01:13:49.397
Please. I worry about you.

971
01:13:49.560 --> 01:13:51.994
If I don't do something, Dana will die.

972
01:13:52.160 --> 01:13:54.515
Risking your life for a girl
you've known a week.

973
01:13:54.680 --> 01:13:55.680
Why?

974
01:13:58.200 --> 01:13:59.553
Heavy sigh.

975
01:13:59.720 --> 01:14:01.199
What's the plan?

976
01:14:01.360 --> 01:14:03.476
Find the person who wants to kill her.

977
01:14:03.800 --> 01:14:04.835
And?

978
01:14:05.440 --> 01:14:06.793
Shoot them in the head.

979
01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:22.274
Last one.

980
01:16:22.440 --> 01:16:26.115
Wolff, two "F" s, Christian.

981
01:16:27.800 --> 01:16:29.836
Two hundred and forty five men.

982
01:16:31.520 --> 01:16:33.670
Four with incomes over a million.

983
01:16:35.960 --> 01:16:38.554
All over the age of 60. Sorry.

984
01:16:38.800 --> 01:16:41.837
Right.
Your guy's an accountant.

985
01:16:43.040 --> 01:16:46.191
Two Christian Wolffs own CPA firms.

986
01:16:46.360 --> 01:16:49.193
The first Christian Wolff owns...

987
01:16:50.520 --> 01:16:55.150
Wolff Accounting. 121 South Street,
Scottsdale, Arizona.

988
01:16:55.320 --> 01:16:59.199
Income of 435 grand. It's a good year.

989
01:17:00.040 --> 01:17:03.032
So good, we audited him two years ago.

990
01:17:03.200 --> 01:17:04.349
He's clean.

991
01:17:04.520 --> 01:17:06.476
The other Christian Wolff...

992
01:17:08.720 --> 01:17:11.598
Nope. Only 75 grand.

993
01:17:13.680 --> 01:17:16.194
ZZZ Accounting.

994
01:17:17.040 --> 01:17:20.555
Wabash Way, Plainfield, Illinois.

995
01:17:20.720 --> 01:17:21.869
ZZZ.

996
01:17:22.040 --> 01:17:25.555
I mean, it's not exactly
a smart Yellow Pages move.

997
01:17:29.760 --> 01:17:31.273
Wait a second.

998
01:17:33.200 --> 01:17:37.557
Who filed the returns for
Kim's Nails, Wabash Way, Plainfield?

999
01:17:40.560 --> 01:17:43.233
ZZZ Accounting.
Could just be the neighborly...

1000
01:17:43.800 --> 01:17:45.756
Great Mandarin, Wabash.

1001
01:17:48.760 --> 01:17:49.909
ZZZ Accounting.

1002
01:17:50.080 --> 01:17:51.433
Paul's Laundromat.

1003
01:17:55.240 --> 01:17:56.798
ZZZ Accounting.

1004
01:17:58.200 --> 01:18:00.555
Tell me they're all
registered as partnerships.

1005
01:18:02.840 --> 01:18:03.875
Every one.

1006
01:18:04.400 --> 01:18:05.913
Managing partner...

1007
01:18:06.080 --> 01:18:07.229
Christian Wolff.

1008
01:18:16.680 --> 01:18:18.557
- Christian Wolff.
- Come in.

1009
01:18:18.720 --> 01:18:23.271
Christian Wolff, last year, ran $75,543
through his accounting firm.

1010
01:18:23.440 --> 01:18:24.600
Whoa. Who is Christian Wolff?

1011
01:18:24.640 --> 01:18:26.153
The accountant.

1012
01:18:28.800 --> 01:18:30.870
- 75 grand? That's chump change.
- Agreed.

1013
01:18:31.040 --> 01:18:36.717
But he ran another $287765
through Kim's Nails,

1014
01:18:36.880 --> 01:18:41.510
$445,112 through Great Mandarin Chinese,
and you'll love this,

1015
01:18:41.680 --> 01:18:45.992
$505,909 through Paul's Laundromat.

1016
01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:49.639
Paul's Laundromat?
Are you fucking kidding me?

1017
01:18:49.800 --> 01:18:50.835
He's playing with us.

1018
01:18:51.160 --> 01:18:53.560
He can't clean that kind of money
through an accounting firm.

1019
01:18:53.680 --> 01:18:55.193
The paper trail's too heavy.

1020
01:18:55.360 --> 01:18:57.136
So, he's laundering it
through cash businesses.

1021
01:18:57.160 --> 01:18:59.720
All of those are in the same strip mall
south of Chicago.

1022
01:19:00.160 --> 01:19:01.160
ZZZ?

1023
01:19:01.320 --> 01:19:04.471
I mean, he doesn't care about the traffic.
It's a front. All of it.

1024
01:19:04.640 --> 01:19:08.155
Christian Wolff, Carl Gauss,
Lou "Lewis" Carroll.

1025
01:19:08.320 --> 01:19:11.471
He's using the names
of famous mathematicians as a cover.

1026
01:19:14.400 --> 01:19:18.029
Charitable contributions here
to Harbor Neuroscience.

1027
01:19:18.200 --> 01:19:20.316
Last year alone,
that's gotta come to close to...

1028
01:19:20.520 --> 01:19:21.919
$1,000,100.

1029
01:19:22.080 --> 01:19:24.833
That one's not a cover.
That's the real deal. I checked.

1030
01:19:25.840 --> 01:19:27.600
So, you're telling me
this guy risks his life

1031
01:19:27.760 --> 01:19:31.548
doing forensic accounting for some
of the scariest people on the planet,

1032
01:19:31.720 --> 01:19:34.240
collects his fee, goes through
all the trouble of laundering it,

1033
01:19:34.320 --> 01:19:36.117
and then gives almost all of it away?

1034
01:19:37.880 --> 01:19:40.678
Well, what if
he's taking other means of payment?

1035
01:19:43.120 --> 01:19:44.712
Yeah, possible. Yeah.

1036
01:19:46.560 --> 01:19:48.039
I caught him, Ray.

1037
01:19:48.800 --> 01:19:50.028
Maybe.

1038
01:19:50.240 --> 01:19:52.196
Pack a bag. We're going to Chicago.

1039
01:21:05.120 --> 01:21:07.320
90% probability they're all right-handed.

1040
01:21:11.120 --> 01:21:13.270
Up to me, I'd snap four right wrists.

1041
01:21:13.600 --> 01:21:17.115
But maybe you enjoy waiting
on a schoolyard sucker punch.

1042
01:21:19.200 --> 01:21:22.556
Life is a series of choices,
none of which are new.

1043
01:21:24.320 --> 01:21:28.359
The oldest is choosing to be a victim.

1044
01:21:28.520 --> 01:21:30.192
Or choosing not to.

1045
01:21:31.720 --> 01:21:33.790
Second oldest: loyalty.

1046
01:21:34.480 --> 01:21:37.631
Family first, good times or bad.

1047
01:21:43.840 --> 01:21:45.831
Bonjour, fellas.

1048
01:21:49.320 --> 01:21:51.197
They're only glasses.

1049
01:21:53.320 --> 01:21:57.996
You think if you don't fight back,
then maybe they'll like you.

1050
01:21:59.040 --> 01:22:01.759
Stop picking on you, calling you "freak."

1051
01:22:02.520 --> 01:22:04.078
Well, here's what it is.

1052
01:22:04.240 --> 01:22:07.232
They don't like you,
they don't dislike you.

1053
01:22:07.920 --> 01:22:09.433
They're afraid of you.

1054
01:22:09.840 --> 01:22:11.353
You're different.

1055
01:22:12.360 --> 01:22:14.999
Sooner or later,
"different" scares people.

1056
01:22:19.520 --> 01:22:23.035
Victim or not? Make a decision.

1057
01:22:57.360 --> 01:22:58.395
Go.

1058
01:23:13.120 --> 01:23:14.758
You're different.

1059
01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:21.833
Sooner or later,
"different" scares people.

1060
01:24:27.160 --> 01:24:28.513
In here.

1061
01:24:39.760 --> 01:24:41.751
.357 Colt Python.

1062
01:24:42.520 --> 01:24:44.158
Serial number's gone.

1063
01:24:45.720 --> 01:24:46.869
Hydra-Shoks.

1064
01:24:59.040 --> 01:25:00.917
Wireless security cam.

1065
01:25:01.840 --> 01:25:04.229
Infrared, weatherproof.

1066
01:25:04.560 --> 01:25:06.278
He's got a network of 'em.

1067
01:25:06.440 --> 01:25:08.590
Whole backyard's got eyes.

1068
01:25:15.720 --> 01:25:16.948
This is our guy.

1069
01:25:17.120 --> 01:25:20.317
So, why does a guy who's
up to his elbows in cash live here?

1070
01:25:20.520 --> 01:25:24.877
Given his clientele, he figures
blending in will extend his shelf life.

1071
01:25:25.360 --> 01:25:27.157
It's the smart move.

1072
01:25:28.640 --> 01:25:30.676
Well, maybe not smart enough.

1073
01:25:31.560 --> 01:25:34.074
High-tech security cameras back here,

1074
01:25:35.560 --> 01:25:37.551
anybody could roll up in the front.

1075
01:25:38.080 --> 01:25:39.877
How does he cover this?

1076
01:25:43.960 --> 01:25:46.235
Jesus, Mary, and Joseph.

1077
01:25:53.880 --> 01:25:55.598
Don't see that every day.

1078
01:25:57.720 --> 01:26:00.473
Boys, let's have a situation report.

1079
01:26:01.480 --> 01:26:02.549
We good, Ike?

1080
01:26:02.960 --> 01:26:04.279
All clear.

1081
01:26:04.440 --> 01:26:05.555
Rock and roll.

1082
01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:07.797
And how about you, sport?

1083
01:26:08.080 --> 01:26:09.593
It's Bobby.

1084
01:26:10.600 --> 01:26:12.079
I got nothing.

1085
01:26:15.240 --> 01:26:17.913
Okay, yeah, I'm getting a feed
on the camera now.

1086
01:26:18.080 --> 01:26:19.479
Move it to the left side.

1087
01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:23.440
Is all this really necessary?

1088
01:26:24.080 --> 01:26:25.513
You should be watching his home.

1089
01:26:25.680 --> 01:26:26.795
Yeah? What you think?

1090
01:26:27.160 --> 01:26:28.912
That's your idea on the subject?

1091
01:26:29.120 --> 01:26:31.759
Love it when people tell me
how to do my job.

1092
01:26:31.920 --> 01:26:33.751
I believe I recommended
you leave the country.

1093
01:26:33.920 --> 01:26:36.593
- You declined.
- He's an accountant!

1094
01:26:37.160 --> 01:26:40.675
I could see it in his eyes.
The freak wasn't gonna let it go.

1095
01:26:44.600 --> 01:26:45.794
My best to Michelle.

1096
01:26:45.960 --> 01:26:47.154
I will.

1097
01:27:03.960 --> 01:27:06.633
I was old 10 years ago.

1098
01:27:09.800 --> 01:27:11.791
So, what's your story, Medina?

1099
01:27:13.160 --> 01:27:14.479
You know my story.

1100
01:27:14.640 --> 01:27:16.995
I know what the courts said.

1101
01:27:19.720 --> 01:27:23.508
Stuffed a handful of cocaine
up a drug dealer's nose,

1102
01:27:23.680 --> 01:27:26.148
pistol-whipped him
into the trunk of his car.

1103
01:27:27.480 --> 01:27:30.711
I was 17. It was August.

1104
01:27:31.320 --> 01:27:34.915
He cooked for three days, but lived.

1105
01:27:35.200 --> 01:27:36.519
Do you regret it?

1106
01:27:36.680 --> 01:27:39.148
The coke was half borax.

1107
01:27:39.680 --> 01:27:42.035
Same shit he kept selling my sister.

1108
01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:45.992
She's a dental hygienist in Annapolis now.

1109
01:27:46.160 --> 01:27:48.196
Married, three kids.

1110
01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:53.433
No, I don't regret it.

1111
01:27:54.720 --> 01:27:56.358
That's rough.

1112
01:27:57.520 --> 01:27:59.556
All due respect, Director King,

1113
01:27:59.720 --> 01:28:02.188
what the fuck do you know about "rough"?

1114
01:28:06.960 --> 01:28:08.916
Wait! I gotta call it in!

1115
01:28:09.080 --> 01:28:10.080
Move it!

1116
01:28:10.240 --> 01:28:11.878
You tell me, Medina.

1117
01:28:17.400 --> 01:28:20.278
Men kill each other
for any number of reasons.

1118
01:28:20.480 --> 01:28:21.600
Bobby, you hear me?

1119
01:28:21.720 --> 01:28:24.393
Money, power...

1120
01:28:24.760 --> 01:28:25.795
Fear.

1121
01:28:25.960 --> 01:28:27.360
Right there, motherfucker!

1122
01:28:30.800 --> 01:28:33.837
Nine men would die
that day at the Ravenite,

1123
01:28:34.960 --> 01:28:36.188
but for none of those reasons.

1124
01:28:39.440 --> 01:28:42.910
No, they'd taken something
from the man who was killing them.

1125
01:28:44.480 --> 01:28:47.074
Something that couldn't
be made whole again.

1126
01:28:48.760 --> 01:28:50.910
Something very important to him.

1127
01:28:52.600 --> 01:28:54.795
And he was there for his pound of flesh.

1128
01:28:54.960 --> 01:28:56.473
Please.

1129
01:28:56.680 --> 01:28:58.079
Just fucking stop, man!

1130
01:28:58.240 --> 01:28:59.878
Just put the gun down!

1131
01:29:01.480 --> 01:29:03.152
Little Tony Bazzano.

1132
01:29:04.440 --> 01:29:06.670
I'd been wedged in a van for six months

1133
01:29:06.840 --> 01:29:09.798
listening to that arrogant little prick
belch, fart, and brag.

1134
01:29:10.280 --> 01:29:11.349
Please.

1135
01:29:11.520 --> 01:29:12.953
I'm fucking begging you.

1136
01:29:13.160 --> 01:29:15.913
I didn't recognize his voice
with all the fear in it.

1137
01:29:16.120 --> 01:29:18.918
I didn't touch him.
I didn't touch that old man!

1138
01:29:19.120 --> 01:29:20.269
I wasn't even...

1139
01:29:25.360 --> 01:29:26.952
Our man had come for revenge.

1140
01:29:28.320 --> 01:29:29.799
And he got it.

1141
01:29:30.840 --> 01:29:32.159
Nine dead.

1142
01:29:34.960 --> 01:29:36.473
And I was 10.

1143
01:29:38.880 --> 01:29:41.075
Your name?

1144
01:29:42.680 --> 01:29:43.874
Ray.

1145
01:29:45.120 --> 01:29:46.712
Raymond King.

1146
01:29:46.880 --> 01:29:49.110
Who employs you, Raymond King?

1147
01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:52.638
I'm a Treasury agent.

1148
01:29:54.360 --> 01:29:55.998
Are you a good one?

1149
01:29:58.480 --> 01:29:59.595
No.

1150
01:29:59.760 --> 01:30:01.318
No, not particularly.

1151
01:30:03.480 --> 01:30:04.708
Is that it?

1152
01:30:07.080 --> 01:30:08.832
Kids, I got... I'm a dad.

1153
01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:10.513
I got two kids.

1154
01:30:12.160 --> 01:30:13.354
Grown?

1155
01:30:15.840 --> 01:30:16.989
Yeah.

1156
01:30:17.680 --> 01:30:20.592
Yes, yes, they're all...
They're all grown up.

1157
01:30:22.400 --> 01:30:24.914
Were you a good dad, Raymond King?

1158
01:30:28.640 --> 01:30:31.154
Yeah. I've been a good dad.

1159
01:30:34.240 --> 01:30:37.835
I'm a lousy agent,
and I've been a weak man,

1160
01:30:39.400 --> 01:30:41.516
but that I didn't screw up.

1161
01:30:43.080 --> 01:30:44.672
That I got right.

1162
01:30:58.760 --> 01:31:00.079
Imagine you're a Treasury agent

1163
01:31:00.240 --> 01:31:04.438
approaching the twilight
of a spectacularly dismal career.

1164
01:31:06.080 --> 01:31:10.596
And then one day, that break
you should have been looking for.

1165
01:31:10.760 --> 01:31:13.877
Francis Silverberg, a black money legend.

1166
01:31:14.040 --> 01:31:17.555
Cleaned cash from Monte Carlo
to Havana to Vegas.

1167
01:31:18.720 --> 01:31:22.793
He cooked the books for the Gambino family
for 40-plus years.

1168
01:31:22.960 --> 01:31:25.394
Until one day, the boss, Big Tony Bazzano,

1169
01:31:25.560 --> 01:31:29.075
thought maybe the old man's age
made him vulnerable to prosecution.

1170
01:31:29.240 --> 01:31:32.277
Ordered his son, Little Tony,
to kill Francis.

1171
01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:34.274
Kid fucked it up.

1172
01:31:34.440 --> 01:31:38.672
Francis ran, became a federal informant
in return for protective custody.

1173
01:31:39.480 --> 01:31:41.948
Could have turned my career around

1174
01:31:42.120 --> 01:31:43.758
if only I'd listened.

1175
01:31:45.680 --> 01:31:46.908
I didn't.

1176
01:31:47.480 --> 01:31:51.155
He was processed out,
and he lost the only protection he had.

1177
01:31:51.320 --> 01:31:52.816
Stand clear of the gate.

1178
01:31:52.840 --> 01:31:57.755
The protection that he was promised
when he testified against Big Tony.

1179
01:32:00.960 --> 01:32:03.633
And this time, Little Tony got it right.

1180
01:32:04.640 --> 01:32:06.596
He had Francis in a couple hours.

1181
01:32:08.120 --> 01:32:11.999
Down in a filthy basement in the Bronx,
nailed to a chair,

1182
01:32:13.640 --> 01:32:15.437
tortured to death.

1183
01:32:18.600 --> 01:32:23.116
So, I volunteered for a joint task force.

1184
01:32:23.640 --> 01:32:26.552
Sat outside the Ravenite
in a surveillance van for months

1185
01:32:26.720 --> 01:32:29.837
hoping to get a shred of evidence
to use against Francis' killers.

1186
01:32:33.640 --> 01:32:34.640
Wait! Wait!

1187
01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:36.115
I gotta call it in!

1188
01:32:37.920 --> 01:32:38.955
Move it!

1189
01:32:39.160 --> 01:32:41.628
I went in there
hoping I could ease my guilt.

1190
01:32:43.960 --> 01:32:45.632
And I met our accountant.

1191
01:32:47.400 --> 01:32:50.039
Why he let me live, I didn't know.

1192
01:32:51.560 --> 01:32:53.278
But he changed my life.

1193
01:32:56.640 --> 01:32:58.676
Gave my notice at the Department.

1194
01:32:59.760 --> 01:33:02.320
I started looking forward
to the day again.

1195
01:33:02.480 --> 01:33:05.199
You know, feeling the sun on my face.

1196
01:33:05.840 --> 01:33:07.319
Quit drinking.

1197
01:33:07.880 --> 01:33:09.677
Was on my way out the door...

1198
01:33:11.320 --> 01:33:12.833
And then, the phone rang.

1199
01:33:13.520 --> 01:33:14.520
Ray King.

1200
01:33:14.680 --> 01:33:16.159
I'll never forget that voice.

1201
01:33:16.360 --> 01:33:18.555
Do you like puzzles, Raymond King?

1202
01:33:20.840 --> 01:33:23.195
She tells me she works for the accountant.

1203
01:33:24.080 --> 01:33:27.436
And that a shipping container
packed with Chinese nationals

1204
01:33:27.600 --> 01:33:30.273
is passing through the Port of New York.

1205
01:33:30.920 --> 01:33:32.433
Few months later,

1206
01:33:32.600 --> 01:33:36.752
one ton of uncut Juárez cartel product
is entering Miami.

1207
01:33:38.880 --> 01:33:41.519
All those cases you put together...

1208
01:33:42.960 --> 01:33:44.359
Smoke and mirrors.

1209
01:33:48.360 --> 01:33:49.713
So, who is he?

1210
01:33:51.240 --> 01:33:52.240
This accountant.

1211
01:33:52.400 --> 01:33:56.109
Prisoner 831.
Fort Leavenworth, maximum security.

1212
01:33:56.320 --> 01:33:57.548
Military prison?

1213
01:33:58.560 --> 01:33:59.879
So, he was in the Army?

1214
01:34:01.480 --> 01:34:04.472
Army lent him to us to track
al-Qaeda money launderers.

1215
01:34:05.720 --> 01:34:09.235
He was transferred from Leavenworth
to our detention center in D. C.

1216
01:34:10.800 --> 01:34:12.711
Did the work of five men.

1217
01:34:12.880 --> 01:34:16.111
Data mining, cluster analysis.

1218
01:34:17.720 --> 01:34:19.278
He roomed with Francis.

1219
01:34:19.720 --> 01:34:22.439
They kept to themselves, played chess,

1220
01:34:22.600 --> 01:34:26.070
ate together, sat in the TV room together.

1221
01:34:27.440 --> 01:34:28.953
They were inseparable.

1222
01:34:30.640 --> 01:34:32.278
And then one day, a guard told Wolff

1223
01:34:32.520 --> 01:34:35.796
why Francis hadn't called or written
since he got out.

1224
01:34:36.480 --> 01:34:40.234
That his burnt body had been found
in a Staten Island landfill.

1225
01:34:42.040 --> 01:34:45.396
Wolff snapped, went after the guard.

1226
01:34:45.840 --> 01:34:48.752
He fractured the man's skull
with a thermos.

1227
01:34:49.600 --> 01:34:51.511
Escaped from a third-floor window.

1228
01:34:52.840 --> 01:34:54.273
Took the thermos.

1229
01:34:54.920 --> 01:34:58.196
That's all you got? I mean, Leavenworth,
he'll have military records...

1230
01:34:58.360 --> 01:35:00.032
Records are all heavily redacted.

1231
01:35:00.200 --> 01:35:01.952
Well, then arrest records, something?

1232
01:35:02.520 --> 01:35:06.479
Spring of 2003, at a funeral home
in Kankakee, Illinois.

1233
01:35:07.960 --> 01:35:12.192
Our boy sends six locals to the hospital
with a variety of injuries.

1234
01:35:13.960 --> 01:35:15.313
No one knew Wolff.

1235
01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:20.278
The older man who came with him
was identified as a colonel, US Army.

1236
01:35:22.400 --> 01:35:23.799
A funeral home.

1237
01:35:24.480 --> 01:35:25.799
Whose wake?

1238
01:35:26.120 --> 01:35:28.190
One customer that day.

1239
01:35:31.400 --> 01:35:33.516
Mrs. Lauren Alton.

1240
01:35:35.720 --> 01:35:39.793
Mrs. Alton taught first grade
for 13 years in Kankakee.

1241
01:35:40.040 --> 01:35:43.476
Survived by a husband
and two boys, ages 12 and 10.

1242
01:35:44.880 --> 01:35:48.031
By all accounts,
an ordinary life, well lived.

1243
01:35:48.840 --> 01:35:50.319
But cut short.

1244
01:35:51.400 --> 01:35:52.674
It'll be all right.

1245
01:35:54.680 --> 01:35:56.400
Excuse me, sir, this is

1246
01:35:56.600 --> 01:35:57.669
family only.

1247
01:35:59.080 --> 01:36:01.833
Sir, I'm going to ask you
to step outside.

1248
01:36:02.520 --> 01:36:06.752
And then a fight breaks out.
A brawl, really.

1249
01:36:06.920 --> 01:36:10.071
Over what,
the authorities never pinned down.

1250
01:36:10.280 --> 01:36:11.349
Get your hands...

1251
01:36:15.720 --> 01:36:17.199
Deputies respond.

1252
01:36:18.080 --> 01:36:22.756
A Barney Fife-type squares off
with our boy, gets rattled, pulls his gun.

1253
01:36:23.360 --> 01:36:26.875
The colonel just stepped in front of 831.

1254
01:36:28.880 --> 01:36:30.393
Army collects both men.

1255
01:36:31.400 --> 01:36:34.198
Police report names Wolff
as "Soldier One."

1256
01:36:34.720 --> 01:36:37.598
And widower
identified the colonel by name.

1257
01:36:38.200 --> 01:36:40.350
His late wife's former husband.

1258
01:36:40.960 --> 01:36:42.791
I checked. It's an alias.

1259
01:36:43.600 --> 01:36:45.909
No more real than "Christian Wolff."

1260
01:36:49.560 --> 01:36:52.279
She was the dead colonel's ex-wife.

1261
01:36:54.800 --> 01:36:57.394
And you think Wolff is what to him?

1262
01:37:04.080 --> 01:37:07.311
Were you a good dad, Ray King?

1263
01:37:16.920 --> 01:37:19.753
I've given up trying to figure out
when I'll get a call.

1264
01:37:19.920 --> 01:37:22.753
The "why" though, that I've got.

1265
01:37:23.800 --> 01:37:25.950
Someone breaks his moral code.

1266
01:37:37.160 --> 01:37:39.116
Why are you telling me this?

1267
01:37:39.440 --> 01:37:41.351
I'm retiring in a few months.

1268
01:37:43.160 --> 01:37:44.832
When she calls,

1269
01:37:46.680 --> 01:37:49.148
somebody needs to be there to answer.

1270
01:38:03.960 --> 01:38:05.109
No.

1271
01:38:08.520 --> 01:38:10.192
He's a criminal, Ray.

1272
01:38:10.400 --> 01:38:11.469
Yeah.

1273
01:38:11.640 --> 01:38:14.791
He aids and abets drug cartels,
money launderers.

1274
01:38:15.800 --> 01:38:17.870
He's a fucking killer.

1275
01:38:18.960 --> 01:38:21.394
Believe me,
I wrestled with the same decision.

1276
01:38:23.160 --> 01:38:25.993
But when I got that first call,

1277
01:38:26.800 --> 01:38:28.631
I realized something.

1278
01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:37.518
I'd spent my whole life only recognizing
my lucky breaks after they were gone.

1279
01:38:44.720 --> 01:38:46.233
The Brit, who is she?

1280
01:39:00.200 --> 01:39:01.269
Hello?

1281
01:39:01.440 --> 01:39:02.839
Miss Medina.

1282
01:39:04.240 --> 01:39:06.993
Tell Eliot Ness to get his feet
off the furniture.

1283
01:39:07.160 --> 01:39:09.037
He's not in a barn.

1284
01:39:10.920 --> 01:39:12.194
Living Robotics.

1285
01:39:13.080 --> 01:39:14.433
Write it down.

1286
01:39:18.840 --> 01:39:21.308
North of six feet, short hair,
athletic build, yes?

1287
01:39:21.480 --> 01:39:23.440
- Correct.
- But when you say short hair,

1288
01:39:23.640 --> 01:39:25.856
you mean short hair like my hair,
or you mean short hair like...

1289
01:39:25.880 --> 01:39:27.029
What's the difference?

1290
01:39:27.200 --> 01:39:28.872
I was told you could fix this, so fix it!

1291
01:39:29.040 --> 01:39:31.360
But you did speak to the man, am I right?
You spoke to him?

1292
01:39:31.520 --> 01:39:32.589
What did he sound like?

1293
01:39:32.760 --> 01:39:36.036
I didn't make small talk.
What's it matter what he sounded...

1294
01:39:37.880 --> 01:39:39.871
That's Ike, right? That's the north side?

1295
01:39:40.560 --> 01:39:42.551
Yo, Bobby, was that you?

1296
01:39:44.560 --> 01:39:45.560
Bob.

1297
01:39:50.400 --> 01:39:51.628
Bobby.

1298
01:39:53.240 --> 01:39:54.389
Ike, are you there?

1299
01:39:56.000 --> 01:39:57.149
Ike?

1300
01:39:58.760 --> 01:40:01.228
Guys, stop fucking around.
Someone answer me. Ike?

1301
01:40:01.400 --> 01:40:03.072
Pull was to the left.

1302
01:40:03.240 --> 01:40:06.755
You might consider using a round
with a superior ballistic coefficient.

1303
01:40:09.760 --> 01:40:11.432
Give me the layout of the home.

1304
01:40:11.600 --> 01:40:14.831
Points of entry, corridors, rooms, cover.

1305
01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:16.000
Go.

1306
01:40:17.760 --> 01:40:19.239
Fuck.

1307
01:40:21.720 --> 01:40:22.800
- Sit down.
- What's this...

1308
01:40:22.880 --> 01:40:24.711
Shut up. Sit down in the chair.

1309
01:40:51.800 --> 01:40:56.635
You ever see a match-grade round traveling
3,000 feet per second go through a window?

1310
01:40:58.920 --> 01:41:00.069
Nobody does.

1311
01:41:00.320 --> 01:41:01.389
Get down, now!

1312
01:41:38.840 --> 01:41:40.671
Four men, front entrance.

1313
01:41:41.480 --> 01:41:43.118
Go right at him. Go now.

1314
01:41:48.720 --> 01:41:49.720
You...

1315
01:41:50.640 --> 01:41:51.789
I got the cameras.

1316
01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:53.592
Go join your friends.

1317
01:41:58.520 --> 01:41:59.520
Up.

1318
01:42:02.480 --> 01:42:03.480
Clear.

1319
01:42:16.760 --> 01:42:17.760
Smoke.

1320
01:42:42.600 --> 01:42:43.953
Go, go!

1321
01:42:45.080 --> 01:42:46.195
Go, go!

1322
01:43:02.160 --> 01:43:03.752
Attack front entry!

1323
01:43:04.080 --> 01:43:05.399
Man down!

1324
01:43:07.640 --> 01:43:09.000
Guys, talk to me.

1325
01:43:13.520 --> 01:43:15.351
You got eyes on who it is?

1326
01:43:16.600 --> 01:43:18.600
Someone talk to me.
Let me know what the sitrep is.

1327
01:43:38.800 --> 01:43:40.028
Are they dead?

1328
01:43:44.960 --> 01:43:47.315
Give me a situation report.
How many down?

1329
01:43:48.320 --> 01:43:49.719
Are they dead? Answer me!

1330
01:43:52.480 --> 01:43:54.914
Okay, he's on the roof.
Start forming up. Let's move.

1331
01:43:55.120 --> 01:43:56.758
Check skylights, check windows.

1332
01:43:56.920 --> 01:43:58.000
That motherfucker comes in,

1333
01:43:58.160 --> 01:44:00.628
I wanna hear gunshots
and I wanna hear "target eliminated."

1334
01:44:11.880 --> 01:44:13.520
That's enough. He's in the goddamn house.

1335
01:44:14.320 --> 01:44:15.435
Get out there and end this!

1336
01:44:15.680 --> 01:44:18.400
Brax, give me a situation report.
Have you got eyes on anything?

1337
01:46:27.440 --> 01:46:29.032
What's happening?

1338
01:46:29.800 --> 01:46:31.119
Say something!

1339
01:46:47.800 --> 01:46:50.997
Solomon Grundy
Born on a Monday

1340
01:46:51.480 --> 01:46:55.268
Christened on Tuesday
Married on Wednesday

1341
01:46:56.160 --> 01:47:00.312
Sick on Thursday
Worse on Friday

1342
01:47:01.480 --> 01:47:05.393
Died on Saturday
Buried on Sunday

1343
01:47:06.520 --> 01:47:10.479
"And that was the end of Solomon Grundy"

1344
01:47:14.160 --> 01:47:15.752
What is this?

1345
01:47:37.200 --> 01:47:38.200
Hey! Hey!

1346
01:47:38.360 --> 01:47:39.429
Stand down!

1347
01:47:39.640 --> 01:47:40.675
Fuck off!

1348
01:48:21.360 --> 01:48:23.078
Hello, Braxton.

1349
01:48:23.920 --> 01:48:25.069
No, no.

1350
01:48:27.920 --> 01:48:29.035
Don't...

1351
01:48:30.040 --> 01:48:31.439
Don't do that...

1352
01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:36.376
Been looking for you for 10 years,

1353
01:48:36.400 --> 01:48:38.616
and you're gonna come at me
like we just saw each other yesterday?

1354
01:48:38.640 --> 01:48:40.278
That's what you're gonna do?

1355
01:48:40.520 --> 01:48:41.669
What did I...

1356
01:48:42.560 --> 01:48:44.118
What'd I think?

1357
01:48:44.280 --> 01:48:47.750
What'd I think? That you were gonna be
happy to see me, I guess.

1358
01:48:49.560 --> 01:48:50.959
I am happy.

1359
01:48:56.440 --> 01:48:58.032
I need to finish.

1360
01:49:00.200 --> 01:49:01.269
You should go.

1361
01:49:01.440 --> 01:49:02.873
I should go?

1362
01:49:04.240 --> 01:49:05.434
Okay...

1363
01:49:06.360 --> 01:49:07.918
Okay, I'll just go.

1364
01:49:08.800 --> 01:49:11.075
But first, I'm gonna ask you a question.

1365
01:49:11.240 --> 01:49:12.639
You're gonna give me an answer.

1366
01:49:14.120 --> 01:49:15.760
Why would you and Pop go to that funeral?

1367
01:49:15.920 --> 01:49:17.440
She left us. Do you not remember that?

1368
01:49:17.600 --> 01:49:19.158
Do you not remember that?

1369
01:49:27.400 --> 01:49:29.436
It's your fault that Pop's dead!
You hear me?

1370
01:49:29.600 --> 01:49:30.600
It's your fault!

1371
01:49:30.760 --> 01:49:32.557
- I'm sorry, Braxton.
- Sorry?

1372
01:49:32.720 --> 01:49:34.631
Sorry doesn't cut it, you weird fuck!

1373
01:49:57.120 --> 01:49:59.953
You don't give a shit about me?
You don't give a shit about me?

1374
01:50:07.200 --> 01:50:08.633
How about now?

1375
01:50:09.800 --> 01:50:10.915
How about now?

1376
01:50:17.240 --> 01:50:19.117
Are you gonna fight?

1377
01:50:21.360 --> 01:50:22.509
Fight!

1378
01:51:14.880 --> 01:51:16.598
I'm sorry, Braxton.

1379
01:51:20.360 --> 01:51:22.430
If you had to see her,

1380
01:51:24.280 --> 01:51:26.999
if that was something that you had to do,

1381
01:51:27.760 --> 01:51:29.273
you call me.

1382
01:51:30.000 --> 01:51:32.878
I'm your brother.
I've always had your back.

1383
01:51:33.880 --> 01:51:36.235
You don't call him, you call me.

1384
01:51:42.960 --> 01:51:44.791
Did you even wonder where I was?

1385
01:51:44.960 --> 01:51:46.598
I knew where you were.

1386
01:51:47.600 --> 01:51:49.716
I just wanted you to be safe.

1387
01:51:49.880 --> 01:51:51.518
Some of my clients

1388
01:51:52.240 --> 01:51:53.639
are quite dangerous.

1389
01:51:56.080 --> 01:52:00.039
I'm, kind of, considered
fairly dangerous myself.

1390
01:52:02.120 --> 01:52:03.712
Well, you've made improvements.

1391
01:52:12.480 --> 01:52:13.913
Shit, man.

1392
01:52:15.080 --> 01:52:16.798
You and me here...

1393
01:52:17.800 --> 01:52:19.119
What are the odds?

1394
01:52:19.280 --> 01:52:20.474
Statistically speaking...

1395
01:52:20.640 --> 01:52:22.631
Christ, man! It's rhetorical.

1396
01:52:22.840 --> 01:52:24.637
I mean, really?

1397
01:52:25.800 --> 01:52:27.199
I was just saying.

1398
01:52:31.320 --> 01:52:33.436
Not happy.

1399
01:52:33.840 --> 01:52:37.276
Do you consider
what you do important, Mr. Wolff?

1400
01:52:37.440 --> 01:52:39.749
To someone other than yourself, I mean?

1401
01:52:40.160 --> 01:52:42.230
What I do is.

1402
01:52:42.800 --> 01:52:46.839
Living Robotics' public offering
would've been worth billions.

1403
01:52:47.000 --> 01:52:49.958
Money to be used
for neuroprosthetics, nanotechnology.

1404
01:52:50.120 --> 01:52:51.155
You...

1405
01:52:53.200 --> 01:52:55.475
Why in God's name did I ever hire you?

1406
01:52:55.640 --> 01:52:57.471
To leak-proof your books.

1407
01:52:57.920 --> 01:53:01.833
Dana found a mistake, and you wanted
to be sure it was safe to go public.

1408
01:53:02.520 --> 01:53:04.112
And now you want to kill her.

1409
01:53:04.280 --> 01:53:05.429
I'm fond of Dana.

1410
01:53:05.960 --> 01:53:08.520
But I restore lives, not Dana! Me!

1411
01:53:08.680 --> 01:53:12.719
Men, women, children,
I give them hope. Make them whole.

1412
01:53:12.880 --> 01:53:14.438
Do you even know what that's like?

1413
01:53:14.640 --> 01:53:15.868
Yes, I do.

1414
01:53:30.360 --> 01:53:31.509
Sorry.

1415
01:53:35.400 --> 01:53:36.879
I missed you.

1416
01:53:44.040 --> 01:53:45.792
"Missed you, too, Braxton.

1417
01:53:48.400 --> 01:53:50.231
"Missed you, too, because I love you.

1418
01:53:51.400 --> 01:53:53.072
"You're my brother."

1419
01:53:55.680 --> 01:53:56.908
Maybe...

1420
01:53:57.680 --> 01:53:59.272
Do you want to...

1421
01:54:00.240 --> 01:54:02.231
Maybe I could see you in a week?

1422
01:54:02.400 --> 01:54:04.595
You name the place. I'll be there.

1423
01:54:18.600 --> 01:54:20.352
How will I find you?

1424
01:54:21.600 --> 01:54:22.953
You won't.

1425
01:54:23.600 --> 01:54:25.192
I'll find you.

1426
01:54:31.320 --> 01:54:32.320
There.

1427
01:54:33.800 --> 01:54:35.438
How do you respond to rumors

1428
01:54:35.680 --> 01:54:38.956
that some of the victims have wounds
consistent with anti-aircraft rounds?

1429
01:54:39.120 --> 01:54:40.951
I'd say the Chicago Police Department

1430
01:54:41.120 --> 01:54:44.112
has ample experience
solving all manner of homicides.

1431
01:54:46.600 --> 01:54:47.635
Tom.

1432
01:54:47.840 --> 01:54:49.796
Sir, how are the conspiracy
and fraud charges

1433
01:54:49.960 --> 01:54:52.679
related to the deaths of Lamar Blackburn
and his sister, Rita?

1434
01:54:52.840 --> 01:54:54.990
This is a very fluid situation

1435
01:54:55.520 --> 01:54:59.115
with a lot of surprising revelations
over the last 48 hours.

1436
01:54:59.320 --> 01:55:02.915
Let me introduce you to the person
leading the investigation...

1437
01:55:04.040 --> 01:55:05.155
Agent Medina.

1438
01:55:15.640 --> 01:55:16.675
Um...

1439
01:55:16.960 --> 01:55:18.188
Good afternoon.

1440
01:55:21.720 --> 01:55:24.917
As much as I'd like
to take credit for this,

1441
01:55:26.080 --> 01:55:27.752
I can't.

1442
01:55:35.280 --> 01:55:37.714
Because this was a team effort

1443
01:55:38.360 --> 01:55:42.558
comprised of long hours
of good old-fashioned investigative work.

1444
01:55:42.720 --> 01:55:43.720
Questions?

1445
01:55:50.560 --> 01:55:53.552
He was just like our other two.
He was a happy baby.

1446
01:55:54.080 --> 01:55:56.548
Now he rarely speaks.

1447
01:55:57.200 --> 01:55:59.634
It's like our child is missing.
He's not there.

1448
01:55:59.800 --> 01:56:02.189
He's lost, and he needs our help.

1449
01:56:03.360 --> 01:56:04.873
We thought...

1450
01:56:06.560 --> 01:56:07.879
We thought...

1451
01:56:08.040 --> 01:56:10.713
We hoped that he would catch back up.

1452
01:56:11.640 --> 01:56:12.868
But he didn't.

1453
01:56:13.040 --> 01:56:15.110
One in 68 children in this country

1454
01:56:15.320 --> 01:56:18.278
are diagnosed with a form of autism.

1455
01:56:18.440 --> 01:56:19.953
But if you can put aside for a moment

1456
01:56:20.160 --> 01:56:23.755
what your pediatrician and all
the other NTs have said about your son...

1457
01:56:23.920 --> 01:56:25.239
What? NTs?

1458
01:56:25.720 --> 01:56:27.597
Neurotypicals.

1459
01:56:27.800 --> 01:56:29.438
The rest of us.

1460
01:56:30.720 --> 01:56:32.312
What if we're wrong?

1461
01:56:32.920 --> 01:56:34.990
What if we've been using the wrong tests

1462
01:56:35.160 --> 01:56:38.470
to quantify intelligence
in children with autism?

1463
01:56:40.080 --> 01:56:41.638
Your son's not less-than.

1464
01:56:43.120 --> 01:56:44.599
He's different.

1465
01:56:45.400 --> 01:56:49.313
Now, your expectations for your son
may change over time.

1466
01:56:49.520 --> 01:56:53.911
They might include
marriage, children, self-sufficiency.

1467
01:56:54.080 --> 01:56:55.638
And they might not.

1468
01:56:56.760 --> 01:56:57.795
But I guarantee you,

1469
01:56:57.960 --> 01:57:01.794
if we let the world set expectations
for our children, they'll start low...

1470
01:57:03.600 --> 01:57:04.999
And they'll stay there.

1471
01:57:07.520 --> 01:57:10.353
Maybe your son's capable of
much more than we know.

1472
01:57:12.200 --> 01:57:13.758
And maybe,

1473
01:57:14.000 --> 01:57:16.116
just maybe,

1474
01:57:16.280 --> 01:57:17.952
he doesn't understand how to tell us.

1475
01:57:19.840 --> 01:57:21.273
Or...

1476
01:57:22.280 --> 01:57:24.874
We haven 't yet learned how to listen.

1477
01:57:51.360 --> 01:57:53.715
Honey, for the hundredth time,
don't wander off like that.

1478
01:57:54.160 --> 01:57:56.515
- I'm so sorry.
- It's all right. It's fine.

1479
01:57:56.680 --> 01:57:58.636
Can he visit with you
for a while, Justine?

1480
01:58:00.840 --> 01:58:03.149
Okay, good. Come on, folks.
I'll give you the nickel tour.

1481
01:58:03.320 --> 01:58:04.355
You okay with that?

1482
01:58:04.840 --> 01:58:06.512
It's okay, hon. Come on.

1483
01:58:06.720 --> 01:58:08.392
No, they'll be fine.

1484
01:58:11.040 --> 01:58:13.349
Justine's one of
our few full-time residents.

1485
01:58:13.560 --> 01:58:15.835
She stopped talking 30 years ago.

1486
01:58:16.000 --> 01:58:18.514
Communicates with
a digital translator now.

1487
01:58:19.360 --> 01:58:21.157
Doctor, how is Harbor funded?

1488
01:58:21.360 --> 01:58:24.716
We're fortunate to have
very generous private donors.

1489
01:58:24.880 --> 01:58:26.199
I'll say they're generous.

1490
01:58:26.360 --> 01:58:27.600
Oh, why is that?

1491
01:58:27.760 --> 01:58:29.512
That woman, Justine...

1492
01:58:29.680 --> 01:58:31.910
- Yeah, my daughter.
- She's your daughter?

1493
01:58:32.120 --> 01:58:34.350
The reason I started the institute.

1494
01:58:34.840 --> 01:58:37.274
Justine's computer, it's a BX32.

1495
01:58:37.560 --> 01:58:39.516
Water-cooled, 12 core.

1496
01:58:39.960 --> 01:58:42.520
Oh, that's right.
You're a software engineer.

1497
01:58:42.680 --> 01:58:46.434
Well, some of our donors
are more generous than others.

1498
01:58:46.640 --> 01:58:48.596
Why? Is that a good computer?

1499
01:58:49.120 --> 01:58:50.394
Good?

1500
01:58:50.880 --> 01:58:53.633
Doc, she could backdoor
the Pentagon with that rig.

1501
01:58:56.800 --> 01:58:59.394
Hello, dreamboat. Shall we chat?

1502
01:59:26.080 --> 01:59:27.308
- Hi.
- Hi.

1503
01:59:27.480 --> 01:59:28.754
Sign here, please.

1504
01:59:32.080 --> 01:59:33.274
Thank you.

1505
01:59:35.320 --> 01:59:36.548
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

1505
01:59:37.305 --> 02:00:37.678
